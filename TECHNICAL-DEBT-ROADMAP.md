# Technical Debt Roadmap - Infamous Freight Enterprises

**Created**: February 22, 2026  
**Status**: Phase 5 - Post-Production Readiness Analysis  
**Total Debt Items**: 1,139 identified  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 weeks for complete resolution

---

## Executive Summary

After achieving production readiness (0 TypeScript errors, 0 critical vulnerabilities), a comprehensive codebase scan identified **1,139 technical debt items** across three categories:

- **380 CRITICAL/URGENT/BUG markers** - High priority, business impact
- **648 TODO/REFACTOR items** - Medium priority, code quality
- **39 HACK/XXX items** - Low-medium priority, code debt
- **72 OPTIMIZE/PERF items** - Low priority, performance

This roadmap prioritizes these items for engineering team planning and sprint allocation.

## Risk Mitigation

### Regression Prevention

- **Pre-deployment Testing**
  - Run full test suite
  - Performance baseline comparison
  - Security scanning

- **Canary Deployments**
  - 5% traffic initially
  - Monitor for 24 hours
  - Gradual rollout to 100%

- **Monitoring & Alerts**

  - Response time > 500ms: Alert
  - Memory usage > 80%: Alert

### Rollback Procedures

- Keep 2 previous versions deployed
- Automated rollback on critical error
- Manual rollback capability
- 30-minute RTO target (Recovery Time Objective)

## Conclusion

The codebase is **production ready** but has natural technical debt from development. This roadmap provides a **12-week structured plan** to:

1. **Eliminate critical issues** (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Improve code quality** (Weeks 3-6)
3. **Resolve technical debt** (Weeks 7-10)
4. **Optimize performance** (Weeks 9-10)
5. **Establish observability** (Weeks 11-12)

**Expected Outcome**: A codebase with < 500 tech debt items, 95% type coverage, zero HACK items, and measurable performance improvements ready for 2-3 year maintenance cycle.
