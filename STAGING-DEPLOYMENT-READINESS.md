### Deployment Procedures

**Pre-Staging Deployment (24 hours before)**:
- [ ] Environment variables reviewed against `.env.example`
- [ ] Database backup system tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] On-call engineer assigned
- [ ] Alert thresholds configured

**Staging Deployment Steps**:
1. Pull code: `git pull origin main`
2. Install deps: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. Run migrations: `cd apps/api && pnpm prisma:migrate:deploy`
4. Build apps: `pnpm build`
5. Start services: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d`
6. Verify health: Both `/api/health` and `/health` responding

**Staging Validation (72 hours)**:
- Monitor error rates (baseline established)
- Verify Firebase auth flows
- Test S3 operations (exercises XXE vector)
- Validate email delivery (billing notifications)
- Check API response times < 200ms P50

**Production Approval Gate**:
- [ ] Staging validation passed
- [ ] Security review of CRITICAL XXE vulnerability completed
- [ ] Firebase 12.9.0 auth confirmed working
- [ ] Load testing passed (if applicable)
- [ ] Rollback procedure verified

## Known Limitations & Mitigations

### 1. CRITICAL: fast-xml-parser XXE Injection (aws-sdk)

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL (10.0)  
**Status**: Blocked on AWS SDK team fix  
**Mitigation**: ✅ Input validation implemented  

**In Production**:
- All S3 XML responses validated before processing
- Error handling graceful on parse failures
- Rate limiting prevents rapid exploitation (20/min on AI commands)
- Sentry tracks XML parse errors for monitoring
- See [apps/api/src/routes/billing.js](apps/api/src/routes/billing.js) for implementation

**Action**: Monitor AWS SDK releases monthly, deploy fix within 1 week of release

### 2. HIGH: React Native 0.73.4 Chain (13 vulnerabilities)

**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH (7.5-9.0)  
**Status**: Blocked on React Native 0.74+ release  
**Impact**: Mobile app only (web + API not affected)  

**Timeline**: Q1 2026 planning, Q2 2026 implementation, Q3 2026 deployment

**Current Mitigation**:
- Mobile app not deployed to production yet
- Internal testing only at this stage
- Production mobile deployment deferred until RN 0.74

### 3. MODERATE: ajv ReDoS (Build-time Only)

**Severity**: 🟡 MODERATE (5-7)  
**Status**: Acceptable for current deployment  
**Reason**: Only affects build-time schema validation, no runtime impact  

**Mitigation**: ESLint 10.x migration planned Q2 2026

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Immediate Post-Deployment (First Hour)

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker logs -f app-api-1 | grep ERROR
docker logs -f app-web-1

# Verify health endpoints
curl http://staging:4000/api/health
curl http://staging:3000/health

# Monitor error rates
# Should be 0-1% baseline until traffic increases
```

### Ongoing Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- API response time P50, P95, P99 (target: <100ms, <500ms, <2s)
- Error rate (target: <1%)
- Database connection pool usage (target: <80%)
- XXE detection rate (target: 0, any spike = incident)
- JWT auth failures (target: <1%)

**Alert Rules** (Recommended):
- Error rate > 5% → Page on-call (CRITICAL)
- Response time P95 > 1s → Alert Slack (P1)
- XXE detection triggered → Page on-call (CRITICAL)
- Database pool > 80% → Alert Slack (P1)

---

## Rollback Procedure

**If critical issues detected within 1 hour of deployment**:

```bash
# 1. Immediately revert to previous version
git checkout HEAD~1

# 2. Stop current services
docker-compose down

# 3. Restart with previous build
docker-compose up -d --build

# 4. Verify health (should be back to normal)
curl http://staging:4000/api/health

# 5. Incident report required
# See RUN_BOOK.md for full incident procedures
```

**Estimated Rollback Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Data Risk**: Low (with proper backups pre-deployment)
