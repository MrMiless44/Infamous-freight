## 🎯 **YOUR 3 SIMPLE STEPS TO GO LIVE (5% Manual)**

### **Step 1: Deploy API to Railway** (10-15 minutes)

**Go to**: https://railway.app/dashboard

**Click**: New Project → Deploy from GitHub → Select: **MrMiless44/Infamous-freight**

**Configure**:
- Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.api`
- Port: `3001`
- Environment Variables (paste these):

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
API_PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=ZYBpTP8D2oMg78DUZfmkVbNol2z5P9xRhrjSdSEkS5s=
DB_PASSWORD=yChsWR2m1HKfAIVtsrWF
CORS_ORIGINS=https://infamous-freight-enterprises.vercel.app
AI_PROVIDER=synthetic
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

**Add**: PostgreSQL database (Railway will auto-provision)

**Deploy**: Click "Deploy" and wait for green checkmark ✅

---

### **Step 2: Get Your Railway API URL** (30 seconds)

Once deployment succeeds in Railway:

1. Click on the API service
2. Go to "Settings"
3. Find **"Public URL"** or **"Railway Domain"**
4. It will look like: `https://infamous-freight-api.railway.app`
5. **Copy this URL** 📋

---

### **Step 3: Update Vercel** (2 minutes)

**Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

**Select**: "Infamous Freight" project

**Navigate**: Settings → Environment Variables

**Find or Create**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

**Set Value**: (paste your Railway URL from Step 2)
```
https://your-railway-api-url
```

**Save** and wait for automatic redeploy

**Done!** ✅

---

## ✨ **AFTER YOU COMPLETE THE 3 STEPS - AUTO VERIFICATION**

Your deployment will automatically have:

```
✅ API running on Railway with PostgreSQL
✅ Web app running on Vercel with API connected
✅ SSL/TLS certificates (automatic)
✅ Health checks passing
✅ Sentry monitoring live
✅ Logging & analytics active
✅ CORS configured
✅ Database migrations applied
```

---

## 🧪 **VERIFY IT'S WORKING**

### Test API Health (copy-paste to terminal):
```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://your-railway-api-url/api/health

# Expected response:
{"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
```

### Test Web App:
```
https://infamous-freight-enterprises.vercel.app
```
- Should load in browser
- Should show landing page or login
- Open DevTools console - should see NO CORS errors

### Test Login:
```
https://infamous-freight-enterprises.vercel.app/auth/sign-in
- Try to log in
- Should connect to Railway API
```
