# Infæmous Freight

---

## Overview

Infæmous Freight is an AI-powered freight and logistics operations platform built to optimize dispatch workflows, shipment visibility, fleet coordination, and operational intelligence.

The platform combines modern logistics infrastructure with AI-driven automation and analytics to help carriers, dispatch teams, and logistics operators run efficient freight operations.

The repository is organized as a pnpm monorepo delivering a unified platform across API, web, and mobile surfaces.

---

## Platform Vision

The goal of Infæmous Freight is to become a logistics intelligence platform capable of:

- dispatch automation
- operational analytics
- fleet intelligence
- shipment lifecycle visibility
- driver coordination
- AI-driven operational insights

Rather than acting as a simple load management tool, Infæmous Freight is designed as a freight operating system.

---

## Product Architecture

The Infæmous ecosystem consists of three major layers.

### Infæmous Freight

**Category:** Core Product

The primary logistics platform responsible for managing freight operations.

Capabilities include:

- dispatch workflow automation
- shipment lifecycle tracking
- fleet activity monitoring
- routing intelligence
- operational dashboards
- logistics analytics

Infæmous Freight acts as the system of record for logistics workflows.

---

### Genesis Avatar

**Category:** AI Interface Layer

Genesis Avatar is the conversational AI and avatar interface used to interact with the platform.

Capabilities include:

- conversational operational queries
- AI-driven command execution
- logistics insights
- workflow assistance
- cross-surface assistant experience

Genesis Avatar provides the AI interaction layer for the platform.

---

### Platform Infrastructure

Supporting infrastructure powers the entire ecosystem:

- authentication
- tenant isolation
- data orchestration
- observability
- API infrastructure
- shared domain models

These components support the platform but are not standalone products.

git clone https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight.git
cd Infamous-freight
```

Enable pnpm via Corepack.

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.0 --activate
```

Copy environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build the workspace.

```bash
pnpm build
```

---

## Development

### API

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

### Web Dashboard

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

### Mobile App

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
```

---

## Local Infrastructure

Infæmous Freight includes a local infrastructure environment for development.

Services include:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- API container

Start infrastructure

```bash
make infra-up
```

View logs

```bash
make infra-logs
```

Run health smoke test

```bash
make smoke
```

Stop infrastructure

```bash
make infra-down
```

The smoke test validates the `/health` endpoint to confirm that the platform services are operational.

---

## Validation

```bash
pnpm run validate
```

Or step-by-step:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

---

## Makefile Commands

Common development helpers are available via make.

```bash
make install
make build
make typecheck
make lint
make test
make validate
make dev
make infra-up
make infra-down
make infra-logs
make smoke
```
