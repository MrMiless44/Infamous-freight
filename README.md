## Canonical rules

1. `apps/` is the primary home for runnable product applications.
2. `packages/` is the primary home for reusable TypeScript libraries.
3. `ai/` is the primary home for standalone Python/ML services.
4. `@compliance/` is the canonical home for compliance code and schemas.
5. `k6/` is the preferred home for load/performance scenarios.
6. Infrastructure may remain split by tool, but every infra root must be documented.
7. New top-level directories require justification, ownership, and a README.
