# Infæmous Freight

---

## Overview

Infæmous Freight is an AI-powered freight and logistics operations platform built to optimize dispatch workflows, shipment visibility, fleet coordination, and operational intelligence.

The platform combines modern logistics infrastructure with AI-driven automation and analytics to help carriers, dispatch teams, and logistics operators run efficient freight operations.

The repository is organized as a pnpm monorepo delivering a unified platform across API, web, and mobile surfaces.

---

## Platform Vision

The goal of Infæmous Freight is to become a logistics intelligence platform capable of:

- dispatch automation
- operational analytics
- fleet intelligence
- shipment lifecycle visibility
- driver coordination
- AI-driven operational insights

Rather than acting as a simple load management tool, Infæmous Freight is designed as a freight operating system.

---

## Product Architecture

The Infæmous ecosystem consists of three major layers.

### Infæmous Freight

**Category:** Core Product

The primary logistics platform responsible for managing freight operations.

Capabilities include:

- dispatch workflow automation
- shipment lifecycle tracking
- fleet activity monitoring
- routing intelligence
- operational dashboards
- logistics analytics

Infæmous Freight acts as the system of record for logistics workflows.

---

### Genesis Avatar

**Category:** AI Interface Layer

Genesis Avatar is the conversational AI and avatar interface used to interact with the platform.

Capabilities include:

- conversational operational queries
- AI-driven command execution
- logistics insights
- workflow assistance
- cross-surface assistant experience

Genesis Avatar provides the AI interaction layer for the platform.

---

### Platform Infrastructure

Supporting infrastructure powers the entire ecosystem:

- authentication
- tenant isolation
- data orchestration
- observability
- API infrastructure
- shared domain models

These components support the platform but are not standalone products.

## Monorepo Structure

```text
apps/
  api/        Backend logistics engine
  web/        Operations dashboard
  mobile/     Mobile operations interface

packages/
  shared/     Shared schemas, utilities, domain models
```

> Note: This overview highlights the primary product surfaces. Additional internal workspaces (for example, `apps/ai`, `apps/worker`, and `packages/genesis`) also exist in the pnpm monorepo but are omitted here for brevity.

### Repository Boundaries

To keep onboarding clear in a large repository, use the following ownership model:

- `apps/*` and `packages/*` are the primary pnpm workspace surfaces and default contributors should focus here.
- `infra/*` contains deployment/infrastructure assets and should be treated as operations-owned.
- Top-level experiments, prototypes, and incubating initiatives outside `apps/*` / `packages/*` should be considered non-core unless explicitly referenced by active roadmap docs.

When opening PRs, state clearly whether your change targets:

1. Core product workspace (`apps/*`, `packages/*`)
2. Platform infrastructure (`infra/*`, deployment config)
3. Experimental or incubating surfaces

## Getting Started

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight.git
cd Infamous-freight
```

Enable pnpm via Corepack.

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.15.0 --activate
```

Copy environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

> **Runtime requirement:** this repo enforces Node.js **24.x** (see `.node-version`). If you are not on Node 24.x, `pnpm` will fail with `ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE`.
>
> If you hit that error, switch to Node 24 and retry install:
>
> ```bash
> nvm install 24
> nvm use 24
> corepack enable
> corepack prepare pnpm@10.15.0 --activate
> pnpm install
> ```

Initialize database tooling for local development.

```bash
# PostgreSQL CLI required for createdb
createdb infamous_freight
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

Build the workspace.

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Android (Termux) Node.js setup

If you are developing from Android (for example, a Samsung Galaxy device), use the official Termux build from **F-Droid** or **GitHub**. Do not use the deprecated Google Play release.

1. Update Termux packages:

   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
   ```

2. Remove existing Node.js packages (only one of `nodejs` or `nodejs-lts` can be installed at a time):

   ```bash
   pkg uninstall nodejs nodejs-lts -y
   ```

3. Install Node.js and verify versions:

   ```bash
   pkg install nodejs -y
   node -v    # expect v24.x.x (or the major version specified in Runtime Policy / .nvmrc)
   npm -v
   npm -v
   ```

5. Install pnpm and verify:

   ```bash
   corepack enable
   corepack prepare pnpm@10.15.0 --activate
   pnpm -v
   ```

6. Reinstall workspace dependencies in your project:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   pnpm install
   ```

## Development

Canonical developer interface is `pnpm` scripts. `make` targets are convenience wrappers around the same flows.

Recommended daily workflow:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:api
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

### API

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

### Web Dashboard

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

### Mobile App

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
```

---

## Local Infrastructure

Infæmous Freight includes a local infrastructure environment for development.

Services include:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- API container

Start infrastructure

```bash
make infra-up
```

View logs

```bash
make infra-logs
```

Run health smoke test

```bash
make smoke
```

Stop infrastructure

```bash
make infra-down
```

The smoke test validates the `/health` endpoint to confirm that the platform services are operational.

---

## Validation

Before opening a pull request, run the validation suite.

```bash
pnpm run validate
```

Or step-by-step:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

CI enforces baseline test coverage thresholds (lines/functions/statements: 70%, branches: 60%) for coverage-enabled test suites.

## Runtime Policy

- Required runtime: Node.js 24.x
- Required package manager: pnpm 10.x
- Source of truth: `.nvmrc` + root `package.json` engines

If your local runtime does not match these versions, switch with your version manager before running installs or checks.

---

## Makefile Commands

Common development helpers are available via make.

```bash
make install
make build
make typecheck
make lint
make test
make validate
make dev
make infra-up
make infra-down
make infra-logs
make smoke
```
