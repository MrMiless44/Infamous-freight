# 🚛 Infamous Freight

> **The freight dispatch platform built by truckers, for truckers.**

Infamous Freight is an AI-powered freight operations platform for dispatch execution, shipment visibility, driver coordination, compliance workflows, and logistics automation.

Built as a monorepo, the platform combines an Express 4 backend, React web application, Prisma/PostgreSQL data workflows, real-time communications, billing flows, and operational tooling for modern freight teams.

If you want one system for dispatch, tracking, paperwork, and operations control, this is the platform.

## 🔥 What It Does

Infamous Freight is designed to reduce manual dispatch work, improve load execution speed, increase margin per load, and centralize day-to-day freight operations in one system.

It brings together:

- 🚚 Dispatch automation
- 📍 Real-time tracking and ETA visibility
- 🤖 AI-assisted load matching and negotiation
- 💬 Driver-dispatch messaging
- 📄 Digital paperwork and invoicing
- 💵 Payroll and factoring workflows
- 🛡️ Compliance monitoring
- 📊 Rate analytics and broker intelligence

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Freight teams often operate across too many disconnected systems: calls, texts, spreadsheets, load boards, paperwork, compliance checklists, and delayed status updates.

Infamous Freight is built to reduce that operational drag by centralizing:

- dispatch execution
- shipment visibility
- driver coordination
- paperwork and invoicing
- compliance workflows
- operational reporting

### 🖼️ Social Preview

The GitHub social preview image lives at [`docs/screenshots/infamousfreight-social-preview.png`](docs/screenshots/infamousfreight-social-preview.png) (1280×640 PNG, generated from `infamousfreight-header.svg`).

To regenerate after updating the header SVG:

```bash
npm run social-preview:generate
```

Maintainers must upload the resulting PNG via **Settings → General → Social preview** (GitHub does not accept SVG there and does not expose an API for this setting).

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies + bootstrap environment files

```bash
npm run env:setup
```

This installs workspace dependencies and creates local `.env` files from `*.env.example` for:

- repo root
- `apps/api`
- `apps/web`

Edit the generated `.env` files with the required API keys and environment values.

> Prisma commands run from the repo root, such as `npm run prisma:generate`, load environment values from the root `.env` file. API-local overrides such as `apps/api/.env` may also apply depending on how Prisma is invoked. If the same variable is defined in multiple places, verify which `DATABASE_URL` Prisma will use for that command.

### 2️⃣ Start with Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3️⃣ Or start manually

```bash
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Development Workflow

### Recommended local flow

```bash
npm run env:setup
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

### Common commands

```bash
npm run env:setup
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run test
```

---

## 🧭 Operator Quick Reference

### Local setup

```bash
npm run env:setup
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

### Build and validate

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run validate
```

### Deploy

```bash
flyctl deploy --app infamous-freight
```

### Verify

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl -X GET https://infamousfreight.com/api/health
```

---

## 🔐 Environment References

For deployment-ready variable setup, use:

- [`docs/environment/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_COMPLETE.md`](docs/environment/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_COMPLETE.md) — full reference and verification
- [`docs/environment/CODEX_ENV_VARIABLES.txt`](docs/environment/CODEX_ENV_VARIABLES.txt) — quick copy/paste template
- [`docs/environment/README.md`](docs/environment/README.md) — usage notes

---

## 🧰 Git Remote Troubleshooting

If `git push` fails with:

```bash
fatal: No configured push destination.
```

Configure an upstream remote and branch:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

You can verify remotes any time with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

---

## 🔍 Error Monitoring (Sentry)

`apps/web` is a Vite + React SPA. To set up or re-configure Sentry for it, run the React wizard:

```bash
cd apps/web
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i react
```

> ⚠️ Do not use `-i nextjs` — `apps/web` is not a Next.js app.

### Sentry MCP server

For Sentry issue triage via MCP-compatible clients, configure the Sentry MCP endpoint with environment-based auth (never hardcode or commit tokens):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sentry": {
      "url": "https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use a short-lived token with the minimum scopes required for issue triage, store it in a local secret manager, and rotate immediately if exposed.

Example local setup (do not commit):

```bash
export SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<sentry-token>"
```

### Netlify sourcemap policy

Public requests for `*.map` files are blocked (`404`). Sourcemaps are still uploaded to Sentry during builds when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, and `SENTRY_PROJECT` are configured.

### Optional Sentry environment variables

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry DSN for the API runtime (`apps/api`) | No |
| `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry DSN for the web app | No |
| `VITE_SENTRY_ENABLED` | Set to `false` to disable even when DSN is set | No |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | CI secret for sourcemap upload | No |
| `SENTRY_ORG` | Sentry organization slug | No |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT` | Sentry project slug | No |
| `SENTRY_SOURCEMAPS` | Set to `1` to force sourcemap generation without upload | No |

> Sourcemaps are generated only when `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is present or `SENTRY_SOURCEMAPS=1` is set, so local and PR builds are not affected.

## 🔌 API Example

### Health check

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Tenant-scoped loads request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/loads \
  -H "x-tenant-id: demo-tenant" \
  -H "x-user-role: dispatcher"
```

Expected request headers for protected operational routes:

- `x-tenant-id`
- `x-user-role`

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

CI should use a single package-manager path end to end. This repository is currently documented and scripted around **npm workspaces**, and build, test, and deploy flows should stay aligned to that to avoid lockfile and install drift.

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- 🔐 `FLY_API_TOKEN` — Fly.io deployment token
- 🔐 `VITE_API_URL` — Production API URL
- 🔐 `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` — Stripe publishable key
- 🔐 `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` — optional Sentry auth token for sourcemap upload
- ⚙️ `SENTRY_ORG` — optional Sentry org slug
- ⚙️ `SENTRY_PROJECT` — optional Sentry project slug

Push to `main` and the pipeline deploys:

- 🚚 API to Fly.io
- 🌐 Web to Netlify via Netlify’s native Git integration

### Manual deployment

#### API (Fly.io)

```bash
flyctl deploy --app infamous-freight
```

#### Web (Netlify)

Netlify auto-deploys from the `main` branch via its native Git integration. For manual deploys:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=apps/web/dist
```

### Deploy verification

After deployment, verify:

```bash
curl -X GET https://infamousfreight.com/api/health
```

Also confirm:

- API returns `200`
- database connectivity is healthy
- required env vars are present
- Fly app is listening on the expected internal port
- Netlify build points to the correct API URL

## Operations Shortcuts

Use these root-level scripts for consistent local and CI operations:

- `pnpm run setup:deps-docker` — install workspace dependencies, run Prisma client generation, and validate Docker CLI availability
- `pnpm run setup:clis` — install required deployment CLIs (`flyctl`, `supabase`, `stripe`) into `.tools/bin`
- `pnpm run tools:install` — alias for `pnpm run setup:clis`
- `pnpm run tools:verify` — verify required deployment CLIs are available globally or in `.tools/bin`
- `pnpm run smoke:api:health` — boot the compiled API on `PORT` (default `3000`) and verify `/health`
- `pnpm run snapshot:prod` — run production-readiness snapshot checks (Prisma generate, build, tests, smoke health, optional Docker build)

For PATH setup and CLI troubleshooting, see [`docs/REQUIRED-CLIS.md`](docs/REQUIRED-CLIS.md).
