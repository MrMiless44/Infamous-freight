## Tooling Requirements

- Node.js 22.x
- pnpm 9.x

This repository pins:

- node: 22.x
- pnpm: 9.x
- packageManager: pnpm@9.15.0

## Local Setup

```bash

corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.0 --activate

git clone https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight.git
cd Infamous-freight

# or
pnpm dev:api
```

pnpm dev:web
```

pnpm dev:mobile
```

## Quality Checks

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm validate
```

## Notes

- The root dev script starts the API workspace.
- The shared package is built before recursive build, typecheck, and test commands.
- Environment values should be supplied via `.env` locally and provider secrets in CI / deployment platforms.
- Never commit secrets into workflow files or tracked config.
