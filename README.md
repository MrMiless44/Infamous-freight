## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

**From Root** (recommended):

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start all services in parallel
pnpm api:dev          # Start only API service
pnpm web:dev          # Start only web service
pnpm build            # Build all services
pnpm test             # Run all tests
pnpm test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage
pnpm lint             # Lint all services
pnpm lint:fix         # Fix linting issues
pnpm e2e              # Run E2E tests
pnpm clean            # Clean all node_modules
```

**Individual Services:**

```bash
# API
pnpm --filter infamous-freight-api dev
pnpm --filter infamous-freight-api test
pnpm --filter infamous-freight-api prisma:migrate

# Web
pnpm --filter infamous-freight-web dev
pnpm --filter infamous-freight-web build
npm run start            # Start production server
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
```

### Database Management

- **Run Migrations**: `cd apps/api && npx prisma migrate dev`
- **Studio (GUI)**: `cd apps/api && npm run prisma:studio`
- **Generate Client**: `cd apps/api && npm run prisma:generate`
- **Seed Database**: `cd apps/api && npx prisma db seed`

### AI Coding Assistant

**Codex CLI** is available in the devcontainer:

```bash
codex                 # Start interactive Codex agent
codex --version       # Check version
codex exec --help     # Non-interactive mode
```

**Keyboard Shortcuts** (VS Code):

- `Ctrl+Shift+C` - Start Codex interactive mode
- `Ctrl+Shift+X` - Run Codex exec

See [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md#codex-cli) for more details.

### Code Quality

```bash
# Lint web application
cd apps/web && npm run lint

# Validate API environment
cd apps/api && npm run validate:env
```

## 🐳 Docker

### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Development environment
docker-compose up

# Build and start in background
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Individual Services

```bash
# Start only database
docker-compose up postgres

# Start API + database
docker-compose up api postgres

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up --build
```

### Docker Features

- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized image sizes
- **BuildKit caching** with pnpm store mounts
- **Healthchecks** for service dependency management
- **Named volumes** for cache persistence:
  - `pnpm-store` - Shared pnpm cache
  - `node-modules-*` - Service-specific dependencies
  - `nextjs-cache` - Next.js build cache
- **Environment overrides** via `.env.local`

### Production Deployment

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

### GHCR Images

CI publishes multi-arch images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):

- ghcr.io/<owner>/infamous-freight-enterprises-api
- ghcr.io/<owner>/infamous-freight-enterprises-web

Tags:

- `latest` on `main`
- release tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- commit `sha`

Login and pull:

```bash
echo "$GHCR_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u <github-username> --password-stdin
docker pull ghcr.io/<owner>/infamous-freight-enterprises-api:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/<owner>/infamous-freight-enterprises-web:latest
```

`docker-compose.prod.yml` consumes GHCR images; set `GHCR_OWNER` env to override
the default owner.
