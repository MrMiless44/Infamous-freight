## ✅ Audit Checklist (Sections 1-4)

### Section 1: File Organization & Naming (5-10 minutes)

**Root Level Documentation**
- [ ] Count total `.md` files in root directory
- [ ] Verify all active docs follow `-RECOMMENDED` naming pattern
- [ ] No files match forbidden patterns: `*_STATUS.md`, `*_COMPLETE.md`, `*_100.md`
- [ ] Core files present: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] View: `ls -la *.md | wc -l` (target: < 30 files)

**Subdirectory Organization**
- [ ] `archive/` contains all deprecated files
- [ ] `archive/DEPRECATED_FILES_REMOVED.md` is current
- [ ] `docs/` subdirectories organized by topic
- [ ] `.github/` contains workflows and contributing guides
- [ ] Check subdirs: `find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "docs" -o -name "archive"`

**Naming Convention Compliance**
- [ ] Search for violations: `grep -r "_STATUS\|_COMPLETE\|_100" --include="*.md" . --exclude-dir=archive`
- [ ] Result should return ZERO matches (only archive references OK)
- [ ] Document any exceptions with rationale

### Section 2: Documentation Quality (10-15 minutes)

**Content Accuracy**
- [ ] README.md is current (last updated < 3 months ago)
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md reflects current workflow
- [ ] All RECOMMENDED docs have clear purpose statements
- [ ] API documentation matches current API routes
- [ ] Deployment documentation matches current infrastructure

**Broken Links & References**
- [ ] Search for references to deleted files in RECOMMENDED docs
- [ ] Check common deleted files: `grep -r "DEPLOYMENT_STATUS\|QUICKSTART_100\|AI_ACTIONS_100" --include="*.md"`
- [ ] Fix any broken links found
- [ ] Test 3-5 important links manually (click/open)

**Markdown Quality**
- [ ] Run markdown linter: `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" --ignore node_modules --ignore archive`
- [ ] Check for consistent heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
- [ ] Verify code blocks have language identifiers
- [ ] Check lists are properly formatted
- [ ] Document any linting errors that need fixing

### Section 3: Process & Prevention (5-10 minutes)

**Git Hooks Status**
- [ ] Verify `.githooks/pre-commit-docs` exists and is executable
- [ ] Verify hook is installed: `git config core.hooksPath`
- [ ] Test hook by attempting to commit a forbidden file
- [ ] Expected result: commit should fail with helpful message

**CI/CD Validation**
- [ ] Check if `.github/workflows/doc-validation.yml` exists
- [ ] Verify workflow runs on PR with `.md` changes
- [ ] Review workflow logs from recent PRs
- [ ] Ensure validation is passing in CI

**Team Awareness**
- [ ] Review team documentation of naming conventions
- [ ] Check if new team members know the standards
- [ ] Verify link to DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS-RECOMMENDED.md in README
- [ ] Note any training needs

### Section 4: Archive & Recovery (5 minutes)

**Archive Integrity**
- [ ] `archive/DEPRECATED_FILES_REMOVED.md` is readable and organized
- [ ] Recovery procedures are clear and tested
- [ ] File recovery window documented (default: 1 year)
- [ ] Sample recovery: `git show {commit-hash}:DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_100.md`

**Retention Policy**
- [ ] Document current retention policy
- [ ] Review archived files for candidates to delete permanently
- [ ] Archive files older than 1 year can be deleted if no longer needed
- [ ] Update recovery documentation with any deletions
