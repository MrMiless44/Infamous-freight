**Date**: [Launch Date - 1 Week]  
**Owner**: Security Lead  
**Status**: [ ] Not Started [ ] In Progress [x] Ready to Execute

## Authentication & Authorization (30 min)

### JWT & Token Security

- [ ] JWT secret is 32+ characters, cryptographically random
- [ ] JWT expiry is appropriate (7-30 days)
- [ ] Token rotation is tested (if enabled)
- [ ] No token leakage in logs/errors
- [ ] Tokens are only sent in Authorization header
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (no HTTP)

### Scope Enforcement

- [ ] All sensitive endpoints require scopes
- [ ] Scopes are granular (not just "admin")
- [ ] Routes validate required scopes
- [ ] Default deny policy (require explicit allow)
- [ ] Scope registry documented in ROUTE_SCOPE_REGISTRY.md

### Organization Isolation

- [ ] Users can only access their organization
- [ ] Organization ID in JWT claim (org_id)
- [ ] All queries filtered by org_id
- [ ] Cross-org data access tested & blocked
