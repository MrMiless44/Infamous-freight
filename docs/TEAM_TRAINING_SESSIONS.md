## 🚩 SESSION 2: FEATURE FLAGS & A/B TESTING

### Learning Objectives

- ✅ Create and manage feature flags
- ✅ Set up percentage-based rollouts
- ✅ Configure A/B tests
- ✅ Analyze test results
- ✅ Declare test winners

### Agenda

#### Part 1: Feature Flags (60 min)

**1. Feature Flag Basics (15 min)**

What are feature flags?

- Runtime toggles for features
- Enable/disable without deployment
- Gradual rollout to users
- Quick rollback if issues

**2. Creating Feature Flags (20 min)**

**Demo**: Create a feature flag

```typescript
// Navigate to admin dashboard
http://localhost:3000/admin/feature-flags

// Create new flag
{
  "key": "new_shipment_ui",
  "name": "New Shipment Creation UI",
  "description": "Redesigned shipment creation flow",
  "enabled": false,
  "rollout_percentage": 0,
  "target_users": []
}
```

**Hands-on**: Each attendee creates 2 flags

1. Backend feature flag
2. Frontend UI flag

**3. Rollout Strategies (25 min)**

**Strategy 1: Percentage Rollout**

```typescript
// Start at 5% of users
updateFeatureFlag("new_ui", { rollout_percentage: 5 });

// Monitor for 24 hours
// If metrics good, increase to 25%
updateFeatureFlag("new_ui", { rollout_percentage: 25 });

// Continue: 5% → 25% → 50% → 100%
```

**Strategy 2: User Targeting**

```typescript
// Target specific users
updateFeatureFlag("beta_feature", {
  target_users: ["user123", "user456"],
  target_groups: ["beta_testers", "internal_team"],
});
```

**Strategy 3: Kill Switch**

```typescript
// Emergency disable
updateFeatureFlag("problematic_feature", { enabled: false });
```

#### Part 2: A/B Testing (60 min)

**1. A/B Test Design (15 min)**

**Example Test**:

- **Hypothesis**: New checkout flow increases conversions
- **Variants**:
  - A (Control): Current checkout
  - B (Treatment): New checkout
- **Metric**: Conversion rate
- **Sample Size**: 1000 users per variant
- **Duration**: 7 days

**2. Creating A/B Tests (20 min)**

**Demo**: Set up A/B test

```typescript
// Navigate to A/B test dashboard
http://localhost:3000/admin/ab-tests

// Create test
{
  "key": "checkout_redesign",
  "name": "Checkout Flow Redesign",
  "hypothesis": "New flow increases conversions by 15%",
  "variants": [
    { "key": "control", "name": "Current Flow", "weight": 50 },
    { "key": "treatment", "name": "New Flow", "weight": 50 }
  ],
  "metrics": [
    { "key": "conversion", "type": "binary", "success_event": "purchase_complete" },
    { "key": "cart_abandonment", "type": "binary", "success_event": "cart_abandoned" }
  ],
  "sample_size": 2000,
  "min_runtime_days": 7
}
```

**Hands-on**: Create A/B test for:

1. Email subject line optimization
2. Pricing display format

**3. Analyzing Results (25 min)**

**Statistical Significance**:

```typescript
// View test results
{
  "test_key": "checkout_redesign",
  "status": "running",
  "days_running": 5,
  "results": {
    "control": {
      "users": 1000,
      "conversions": 180,
      "rate": 0.18
    },
    "treatment": {
      "users": 1000,
      "conversions": 225,
      "rate": 0.225
    },
    "improvement": "+25%",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "statistical_significance": true,
    "recommendation": "Declare treatment as winner"
  }
}
```

**When to declare a winner?**

- ✅ Statistical significance > 95%
- ✅ Minimum runtime met (7 days)
- ✅ Sample size adequate
- ✅ Results stable (not fluctuating)

#### Part 2: Rollback Procedures (45 min)

**1. When to Rollback (10 min)**

Rollback immediately if:

- ✅ Error rate spikes > 5%
- ✅ Response time > 2x normal
- ✅ Database corruption detected
- ✅ Security vulnerability exploited
- ✅ Data loss occurring
- ✅ Unable to identify fix quickly

**2. Rollback Execution (20 min)**

**Method 1: Automated Rollback**

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh

# Specify version
./scripts/rollback.sh v2.0.0

# Verify rollback
./scripts/health-check-runner.sh
```

**Method 2: Manual Rollback**

```bash
# 1. Identify previous good version
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Checkout previous version
git checkout v2.0.0

# 3. Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh production --force

# 4. Verify
curl http://api/health
```

**Method 3: Database Rollback**

```bash
# Rollback migrations
cd api && pnpm prisma:migrate:resolve --rollback

# Restore from backup if needed
./scripts/restore-backup.sh 2026-01-14-23-00
```

**3. Rollback Drill (15 min)**

**Scenario**: Critical bug deployed to production

**Team Exercise**:

1. Detect issue (simulated alert)
2. Classify as S1
3. Assemble war room
4. Execute rollback
5. Verify system health
6. Communicate to stakeholders

**Timer**: 10 minutes to complete

#### Part 3: Post-Mortem Process (45 min)

**1. Post-Mortem Template (15 min)**

```markdown
# Incident Post-Mortem

## Summary

- **Incident ID**: INC-2026-001
- **Date**: January 15, 2026
- **Duration**: 23 minutes
- **Severity**: S1
- **Impact**: API unavailable for all users

## Timeline

- 14:32 - Deployment v2.1.0 started
- 14:35 - Error rate spike detected (3%)
- 14:37 - Alert triggered
- 14:38 - War room assembled
- 14:40 - Issue identified (database migration failure)
- 14:45 - Rollback initiated
- 14:50 - Rollback complete
- 14:55 - System verified healthy

## Root Cause

Database migration script contained syntax error that wasn't caught in staging due to different PostgreSQL version.

## Impact

- Users affected: 100% (all users)
- Downtime: 23 minutes
- Revenue loss: Estimated $2,300
- Customer complaints: 47

## What Went Well

- Alert fired within 2 minutes
- Team assembled quickly
- Rollback executed smoothly
- Communication clear

## What Went Wrong

- Staging environment not matching production
- Migration not tested on production-like database
- No pre-deployment validation of migrations

## Action Items

- [ ] Upgrade staging PostgreSQL to match production (Owner: DevOps, Due: Jan 20)
- [ ] Add migration validation to CI/CD (Owner: Engineering, Due: Jan 18)
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployments (Owner: DevOps, Due: Feb 1)
- [ ] Database version check in pre-flight (Owner: Engineering, Due: Jan 17)
```

**2. Blameless Culture (15 min)**

**Principles**:

- Focus on systems, not individuals
- Learn from failures
- Improve processes
- Share knowledge
- No punishment for honest mistakes

**Bad Post-Mortem**:

> "John deployed broken code and didn't test it properly."

**Good Post-Mortem**:

> "Our deployment process allowed untested database migrations to reach production. We need automated validation."

**3. Prevention Strategies (15 min)**

**Common Prevention Tactics**:

1. **Better Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E
2. **Environment Parity**: Staging = Production
3. **Gradual Rollouts**: Canary deployments
4. **Automated Validation**: Pre-flight checks
5. **Feature Flags**: Quick disable without deployment
6. **Monitoring**: Early detection
7. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup, rollback plans

### Hands-On Exercises

**Exercise 1: Incident Simulation**

- Respond to simulated S1 incident
- Execute rollback
- Document timeline
- Complete under 15 minutes

**Exercise 2: Post-Mortem Writing**

- Given incident details, write complete post-mortem
- Include timeline, root cause, action items
- Follow blameless principles

**Exercise 3: Prevention Planning**

- Review historical incidents
- Identify patterns
- Propose preventive measures
- Estimate implementation effort

### Assessment

**Simulation Exam**:

1. Classify 5 incident scenarios (S1-S4)
2. Execute rollback in simulated environment
3. Write post-mortem for given incident
4. Propose 3 preventive measures

**Pass Criteria**: Complete all 4 tasks successfully
