## FMCSA Broker Authority

**Requirement:** A freight broker must hold active FMCSA Property Broker Authority (Form OP-1) before arranging the transportation of freight for compensation.

**Filing:** Submit Form OP-1 to the FMCSA. The filing fee is $300 (non-refundable). Processing typically takes 4–8 weeks after the protest period.

**Protest period:** After filing, there is a 10-day protest period during which existing licensees may object.

**Active status check:** Verify active status at https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov using the MC number.

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] FMCSA OP-1 application submitted
- [ ] MC number received
- [ ] Protest period elapsed with no objection
- [ ] Authority status confirmed as **Active** on FMCSA SAFER system
- [ ] MC number documented in `PRODUCTION_READINESS_EVIDENCE.md`
- [ ] Compliance owner has verified active status

## BOC-3 Process Agent Filing

**Requirement:** All FMCSA-licensed brokers must file a BOC-3 (Designation of Process Agent) before authority is activated. This designates a legal agent in each U.S. state to receive service of process on behalf of the company.

**Filing:** BOC-3 must be filed electronically through a blanket BOC-3 service provider (not filed directly with FMCSA by most brokers). The provider files on behalf of the broker and covers all 50 states and Washington D.C.

**Cost:** Blanket BOC-3 filing services typically cost $20–$50 (one-time or annual, depending on provider).

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] BOC-3 service provider selected
- [ ] BOC-3 blanket filing submitted
- [ ] BOC-3 confirmation received from provider
- [ ] Filing reflected in FMCSA records (verify via SAFER or FMCSA portal)
- [ ] BOC-3 confirmation documented in `PRODUCTION_READINESS_EVIDENCE.md`
- [ ] Compliance owner has verified filing status

## BMC-84 Surety Bond or BMC-85 Trust Fund

**Requirement:** All FMCSA-licensed brokers must maintain a minimum $75,000 surety bond (BMC-84) or a $75,000 trust fund agreement (BMC-85) on file with the FMCSA. This protects shippers and carriers from broker non-payment.

### BMC-84 — Surety Bond

- Issued by a licensed surety company on behalf of the broker.
- Annual premium is typically 1–5% of the $75,000 bond amount (varies by credit).
- Bond must remain continuously active. A lapse cancels broker authority.
- Surety company files BMC-84 directly with the FMCSA.

### BMC-85 — Trust Fund Agreement

- An alternative to the surety bond.
- The broker deposits $75,000 into a trust account with an FMCSA-approved financial institution.
- The financial institution files BMC-85 directly with the FMCSA.
- The full $75,000 must be maintained at all times.

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] BMC-84 or BMC-85 option selected
- [ ] Provider or financial institution identified
- [ ] Bond or trust agreement executed
- [ ] BMC-84 or BMC-85 filing confirmed with FMCSA (verify via SAFER or FMCSA portal)
- [ ] Expiration or renewal date logged (BMC-84 annual renewal required)
- [ ] Bond or trust details documented in `PRODUCTION_READINESS_EVIDENCE.md`
- [ ] Compliance owner has verified active filing
