# System Architecture

Infæmous Freight Enterprise is a multi-tenant AI-first logistics operating
system.

Core layers:

- API (Express + Prisma)
- AI Synthetic Intelligence ♊️ orchestration
- Web dashboard (Next.js)
- Mobile application (React Native)
- Shared domain packages

AI agents are first-class system actors, with the UI remaining as a thin,
stateless shell. All intelligence, validation, and state transitions run
server-side for observability, auditability, and resilience.

## Layered Architecture

Client (Web / Mobile) → API Gateway → AI Orchestration → Business Logic Engine →
Data + Memory Layer → Automation + Jobs

## Implementation Path Map (Authoritative)

Use the following repository paths as the execution reference for current
implementation ownership:

- **UI implementation:** `apps/web/`
- **AI implementation:** `apps/ai/`
- **Financial/billing implementation:** `apps/api/src/routes/billing.js`,
  `apps/api/src/services/`, and `payments/`
- **Shared contracts/types/utilities:** `packages/shared/`

> Note: legacy references to `packages/ui`, `packages/ai-engine`, and
> `packages/financial` are obsolete in this repository and should not be used
> for implementation work.

## Architecture Freeze Policy

To stop structural churn, the architecture is frozen and changes to core
boundaries require an ADR and approval. See
[ADR-0007: Architecture Freeze and Change Control](adr/0007-architecture-freeze.md)
for the decision, scope, and allowed changes.

### Core Responsibilities

- **API Gateway**: Authentication, rate limiting, request normalization, and
  routing to orchestrated skills.
- **AI Orchestration Layer**: Prompt router, skill selection, memory injection,
  model routing, validation, and fallback reasoning.
- **Business Logic Engine**: Domain services for billing, invoice intelligence,
  ERP/TMS integrations, compliance, and workflow state machines.
- **Data + Memory Layer**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for embeddings, optional vector
  index, Redis for cache/session, and durable audit/event streams.
- **Automation + Jobs**: BullMQ/Temporal-backed schedulers for learning loops,
  monitoring, alerts, and auto-optimization tasks.

## Frontend (Web + Mobile)

- **Stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, server actions, auth
  middleware; React Native for mobile.
- **Modules**: Dashboard, AI avatar interface, task/workflow viewer, billing,
  settings, memory/history view.
- **Principles**: Stateless UI, realtime updates via WebSockets, avatar as
  presentation only (no client-side logic), feature flags for rollout.

## AI Synthetic Intelligence Layer

- **Components**: Prompt router, skill modules, memory engine, decision scorer,
  fallback reasoner.
- **Flow**: User intent → classifier → skill match → memory injection → LLM
  execution (OpenAI primary, Anthropic secondary, heuristic fallback) →
  validation → action/response.
- **Safety**: Deterministic validation, tool-use approvals, audit trails per
  decision, and consistent persona (“persistent AI operator”).

## Avatar System

- **State**: Avatar profile + personality matrix + visual state engine +
  interaction history.
- **Capabilities**: Learns user behavior, adapts tone, surfaces proactive
  recommendations, represents AI as a human-like operator backed by memory.

## Memory Engine

- **Types**: Short-term (session), long-term (user), task memory, preference
  memory.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (structured), JSONB for embeddings, optional vector
  index, Redis for fast session/cache.
- **Rules**: Always retrieve before responding, avoid hallucination, decay
  unused memory, promote frequently used memory, include retrieval traces in
  audit logs.

## Backend API

- **Stack**: Node.js 20, Express/Fastify, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Redis.
- **Services**: Auth, AI execution, avatar state, billing, automation, webhooks,
  ERP/TMS connectors, invoice intelligence.
- **Security**: JWT + refresh, rate limiting, encrypted secrets, audit logs,
  SOC2-lite controls.

## Automation Engine

- **Jobs**: Scheduled AI tasks, monitoring, alerts, auto-optimizations, daily
  system learning, data hygiene.
- **Tools**: BullMQ/Temporal with cron fallbacks and idempotent job handlers.

## Billing & Access Control

- **Billing**: Stripe subscriptions + usage metering, AI-call metering,
  plan-based entitlements.
- **Access**: RBAC with scopes, feature flags per role/plan, webhook signing for
  external callbacks.

## Deployment & CI/CD

- **Infrastructure**: Docker for all services; Render/Fly.io for API, Vercel for
  frontend; Supabase/RDS for PostgreSQL.
- **Pipelines**: GitHub Actions with lint/type-check/test gates, build
  artifacts, deployment promotion with rollbacks, environment secrets via secure
  stores.
- **Observability**: Structured logging, request IDs, distributed tracing, SLO
  dashboards, alerting hooks into monitoring tools.

## Complete Platform Blueprint (Genesis-Centered)

The platform interaction model is centered on the Genesis Avatar as the single
command and feedback interface for operators, brokers, and shippers.

### Interaction Principle

Users do not interact directly with backend modules. The canonical flow is:

**Avatar → AI Engine → Logistics Modules → Data/Insights → User Actions**

This preserves a consistent, intelligent operator experience while keeping
orchestration and decisioning centralized.

### Mobile App Layout

Bottom navigation:

- Home
- Load Board
- Shipments
- Routes
- Alerts
- Profile

Home dashboard composition:

- Genesis Avatar panel
- Active shipments list
- Quick actions (Create Shipment, View Load Board, Optimize Routes)
- Alerts stream

The Avatar remains available as a persistent floating action element for AI
command entry.

### Load Board (Easy Access)

The load board is treated as a real-time marketplace and exposed as a primary
navigation destination across mobile and web.

Core elements:

- Search and filters (location, distance, weight, equipment/type)
- Available load cards with lane, weight, and rate
- One-tap claim action
- AI recommendation strip (“Best load for your route today”)

AI load matching factors:

- Driver location
- Fuel cost context
- Route efficiency
- Load profitability
- Deadhead distance

### Web Dashboard Layout

Desktop dashboard composition:

- Left sidebar: Dashboard, Load Board, Shipments, Routes, Analytics,
  Notifications, Support
- Main panel: map + active shipments, shipment cards, alerts panel, and KPI
  widgets

Recommended KPI widgets:

- Active Shipments
- Available Loads
- Routes Optimized Today
- Revenue Today

### Genesis Avatar Behavioral States

| State      | Meaning                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Idle       | Waiting for commands                        |
| Suggesting | Recommending loads/actions                  |
| Alert      | Shipment issue requires attention           |
| Critical   | Delay/route issue requires immediate action |

### Analytics Engine Focus

Operational intelligence should prioritize:

- Average delivery time
- Fuel efficiency
- Load profitability
- Driver performance
- Route efficiency
