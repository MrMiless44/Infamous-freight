# Architecture Overview

> For the full technical narrative, see [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md).

## Monorepo Layout

```
apps/
  api/       Express REST API — auth, routing, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
  web/       Next.js 14 operations dashboard — TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
  mobile/    React Native + Expo cross-platform app

packages/
  shared/    Domain types, Zod schemas, constants, shared utilities
```

## High-Level Layers

```
Client (Web / Mobile)
  └── API Gateway  (apps/api — Express, JWT, rate limiting)
        └── AI Orchestration Layer  (prompt routing, skill selection)
              └── Business Logic Engine  (billing, dispatch, compliance)
                    └── Data + Memory Layer  (PostgreSQL + Redis)
                          └── Automation + Jobs  (BullMQ / scheduled tasks)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Client** | Stateless UI — Next.js SSR pages, React Native screens |
| **API Gateway** | Auth (JWT/JWKS), rate limiting, request validation, routing |
| **AI Orchestration** | Prompt routing, model selection, memory injection, fallback |
| **Business Logic** | Domain services: loads, shipments, billing, compliance |
| **Data Layer** | PostgreSQL (Prisma), Redis cache/session, audit streams |
| **Jobs** | Scheduled tasks, background workers, health checks |

## Key Technology Choices

| Concern | Technology |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js 22.x |
| Package manager | pnpm 10.x (workspace monorepo) |
| API framework | Express + TypeScript |
| ORM | Prisma |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Frontend | Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Mobile | React Native, Expo |
| Auth | JWT (HMAC default, optional RS256 via JWKS) |
| Validation | Zod (shared schemas in `@infamous/shared`) |
| CI | GitHub Actions |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Multi-tenancy**: All database queries are tenant-scoped by construction.
- **Security**: No raw SQL — Prisma only. All endpoints use the standard middleware stack.
- **Shared contracts**: Domain types and Zod schemas live in `packages/shared` and are imported by all apps.
- **Secrets**: Never committed; managed via `.env` locally and GitHub Secrets in CI.
