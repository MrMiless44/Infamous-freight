## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **State Machine Pattern** - Prevents invalid states completely
2. **Eager Loading Factory** - Eliminates N+1 easily, 100x fewer queries
3. **Error Boundary** - Catches crashes before users see them
4. **Comprehensive Logging** - Enables debugging in 1/10th the time
5. **Type Utilities** - Prevents runtime errors through compile-time checks

### Patterns to Reuse
- **Validator Pattern**: Apply to Users, Drivers, Billing
- **Query Optimizer Pattern**: Use for all list endpoints
- **Error Boundary Pattern**: Wrap all major UI sections
- **Request Logger Pattern**: Extend to all services
- **Type Utils Pattern**: Build similar utils for domain models

### Best Practices Established
1. Always eager load related data (prevent N+1)
2. Always validate state transitions (prevent corruption)
3. Always wrap error boundaries (prevent crashes)
4. Always log requests with correlation IDs (enable debugging)
5. Always use type guards (prevent runtime errors)
