# Launch Readiness Index

This is the entry point for production readiness, beta approval, paid launch approval, rollback, and operational recovery.

## Current Status

Ready for verification. Not approved for public launch until all critical checks pass with evidence.

## Required Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_VERIFICATION.md` | Main verification checklist, launch gates, severity rules, and sign-off requirements |
| `docs/LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_LOG.md` | Evidence log template for command output, dashboard checks, blocker notes, and final decision |
| `docs/ROLLBACK_PLAN.md` | Rollback triggers and recovery process for API, web, database, billing, notifications, and support |
| `docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_DATA_PLAN.md` | Controlled production test accounts, freight records, documents, billing data, and cleanup rules |
| `docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION.md` | Stripe live/test mode verification, webhook edge cases, idempotency, refunds, and failed payments |
| `docs/ADMIN_RECOVERY_RUNBOOK.md` | Admin recovery procedures for users, roles, shipments, assignments, documents, billing, and notifications |
| `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_VERIFICATION.md` | Backup configuration and restore proof procedure |
| `docs/NOTIFICATION_DELIVERABILITY_VERIFICATION.md` | Email, SMS, in-app, and support inbox deliverability checks |
| `docs/LAUNCH_BLOCKER_TEMPLATE.md` | Standard format for launch blockers, root cause, workaround, fix plan, and retest evidence |

## Execution Order

1. Assign launch owner, rollback owner, support owner, and technical owner.
2. Open `docs/LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_LOG.md` and fill in run metadata.
3. Create test accounts and test records using `docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_DATA_PLAN.md`.
4. Execute `docs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_VERIFICATION.md` from Phase 0 through Phase 7.
5. Use the specialized runbooks when a phase references backup/restore, Stripe, admin recovery, or notifications.
6. Record every test result in the evidence log.
7. Open a blocker for every failed or unknown critical/high result using `docs/LAUNCH_BLOCKER_TEMPLATE.md`.
8. Approve only the highest launch gate supported by actual evidence.

## Launch Gate Summary

| Gate | Minimum Requirement |
|---|---|
| Private Beta | Core system, auth, freight workflow, logs, basic security, backup existence, and rollback owner verified |
| Paid Beta | Private beta requirements plus Stripe live/test billing proof, webhook idempotency, invoice/receipt flow, support, and admin recovery |
| Public Launch | Paid beta requirements plus restore proof, no critical blockers, security review, real workflow proof, and owner sign-off |

## Hard Rule

Documentation does not equal readiness. A checkbox without evidence is an unknown result. Unknown critical or high-risk results block launch until verified.
