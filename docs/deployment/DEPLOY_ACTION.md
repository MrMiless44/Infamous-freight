## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Generate JWT_SECRET** before deploying:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   # Copy output and use as JWT_SECRET
   ```

2. **Start with Vercel** (faster, takes ~3 min)
   - While Vercel builds, start Fly.io process
   - Saves time overall

3. **Watch the build logs**
   - Vercel: Dashboard → Deployments → Click build
   - Fly.io: Dashboard → Deployments → Click build
   - Shows real-time progress and any errors

4. **After deployment**
   - Save your URLs for reference
   - Add to .env.local in repo
   - Share with team

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

**Vercel Build Fails**

- Check build log for errors
- Common: Wrong framework detected
- Solution: Go to Settings → Framework, select Next.js
- Retry deploy

**Fly.io Build Fails**

- Check build log
- Common: Missing environment variable
- Solution: Add the variable to Settings → Secrets
- Redeploy

**API Returns 500 Error**

- Check logs: fly.io dashboard → View logs
- Common: DATABASE_URL not set or invalid
- Solution: Fix the connection string, set in Secrets, redeploy

**Web Can't Reach API**

- Check browser console (F12)
- Common: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL wrong
- Solution: Fix in Vercel → Environment Variables
- Redeploy web
