```

### 5.4 Check Logs (Optional)

```
Fly.io:

→ Should see lines like "listening on" and no errors

Vercel:
→ Dashboard → Your project → Deployments → Click latest
→ Should see deployment completed successfully
```

**Status**: ✅ EVERYTHING IS WORKING!

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Web Won't Load

```
Problem: Page shows 404 or "not found"
Solution:
  1. Go to Vercel dashboard
  2. Click your project
  3. Click "Deployments"
  4. Check if latest shows ✅ or ❌
  5. If ❌, click and see the error
  6. Most common: Wrong framework detected
     → Go to Settings → Framework → Select "Next.js"
     → Redeploy
```

### API Returns 500 Error

```
Problem: /api/health returns error
Solution:
  1. Go to Fly.io dashboard
  2. Click your app
  3. Click "Monitoring" → "View Logs"
  4. Look for error messages
  5. Most common causes:
     - DATABASE_URL not set → Add to Secrets
     - JWT_SECRET not set → Add to Environment Variables
     - Prisma not initialized → Might need migration
  6. After fix: Redeploy
```

### Web Can't Reach API

```
Problem: Web loads but API calls fail
Solution:
  1. Check browser console (F12)
  2. Look for network error
  3. Most common: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL wrong
  4. Fix:
     → Go to Vercel → Environment Variables
     → Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct
     → Redeploy web
```

### Database Not Connected

```
Problem: /api/health shows "database": "disconnected"
Solution:
  1. Go to Fly.io dashboard
  2. Click "Settings" → "Secrets"
  3. Check DATABASE_URL is set
  4. Test connection string locally (if you can):
     psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
  5. If connection string is wrong:
     → Get correct one from provider
     → Update in Fly.io Secrets
     → Redeploy
```
