# Runbook: Database Emergency - Outage Recovery

**Duration:** 10-30 minutes (depends on root cause)  
**Risk Level:** Medium/High (data integrity critical)  
**Estimated Recovery:** 5-15 minutes for connection issues, longer for
corruption

---

## 🚨 When to Use This Runbook

Use this if experiencing:

- [ ] "Database connection failed" errors
- [ ] Connection pool exhausted
- [ ] Query timeouts (> 30 seconds)
- [ ] 502/503 errors on API
- [ ] Data integrity warnings
- [ ] Replication lag > 5 minutes

**Not this runbook if:**

- Single query is slow (see slow-query runbook)
- Specific table locked (see deadlock runbook)
- Accidental data deletion (see recovery runbook)

---

## Emergency Response

### Step 1: IDENTIFY the Issue (< 2 minutes)

**Check error message:**

```bash
# 1. Look at API logs
echo "Recent errors:"
curl https://api.your-domain.com/api/health
# Note exact error message

# 2. Check Sentry
# https://sentry.io → Issues
# Filter by "database\|connection\|timeout"

# 3. Check database status
# If using Supabase: https://supabase.com/dashboard → Status

# 4. Identify pattern
# All endpoints affected? → Connection pool issue
# Only writes failing? → Replication issue
# Only specific table? → Lock issue
```

**Common symptoms:**

```
"connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432"
  → Database server down or unreachable

"FATAL: remaining connection slots reserved..."
  → Connection pool exhausted

"server closed the connection unexpectedly"
  → Database restarted or crashed

"query timeout after 30s"
  → Slow queries or high load
```

### Step 2: TRIAGE (< 2 minutes)

**Quick assessment:**

```bash
# Is database actually down?
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;" 2>&1
# If error → database is down
# If "1" returned → database is up

# Is the API connection pool saturated?
curl https://api.your-domain.com/api/health
# If instant timeout → likely pool issue

# Is replication healthy?
# Supabase: Dashboard → Logs
# Look for replication lag > 60 seconds
```

### Step 3: ASSESS Severity

**Critical (Execute Triage A):**

- All database queries failing
- Connection refused errors
- Database completely unreachable
- **Action: 🔴 Emergency Response**

**High (Execute Triage B):**

- Some queries timing out
- High latency (> 10s)
- Connection pool occasionally exhausted
- **Action: ⚠️ Stabilization**

**Medium (Execute Triage C):**

- Specific queries slow
- Occasional timeouts
- High connection count but responding
- **Action: ✓ Investigation**

## Response Options (Choose one)

### TRIAGE A: Supabase Database Down 🔴

```bash
# This means SUPABASE is unreachable or having issues

echo "🚨 SUPABASE DOWN - Emergency Response"

# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (< 5 min):

# 1. Notify users
slack #incidents "🔴 CRITICAL: Database service down. ETA 10 minutes."

# 2. Check Supabase status
# Go to: https://status.supabase.com
# This shows real-time infrastructure status

# 3. Monitor for recovery
# Supabase infrastructure is managed by them
# Check status page every 2 minutes
curl https://status.supabase.com

# 4. API service automatically fails over
# Vercel Functions will return 503 until database back

# 5. Verify database connection restored
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[ID]/status
# Check that "PostgreSQL" shows GREEN ✅

# 6. Verify health endpoint restored
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health
# Expected: {"ok":true}

# 7. Communicate recovery
slack #incidents "✅ Database connection restored. Verifying stability..."
```

**Expected timeline:**

- Supabase downtime: 5-15 minutes (managed by Supabase)
- Automatic API failover: Immediate (returns 503)
- Service verification: 2-3 minutes after recovery
- **Total: 7-18 minutes**

---

### TRIAGE B: Supabase Connection Pool Issues ⚠️

```bash
# This means SUPABASE is up, but connections exhausted

echo "⚠️  CONNECTION POOL ISSUE - Stabilization (Supabase Managed)"

# IMPORTANT: Supabase manages connection pooling automatically
# pgBouncer is built-in and handles pool overflow

# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (< 2 min):

# 1. Check Supabase dashboard for connection stats
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[ID]/logs
# Look for connection warnings

# 2. Check if there are long-running queries
# Go to: Project → SQL Editor → Logs
# Look for queries taking > 30 seconds

# 3. Vercel auto-retry will handle temporary issues
# Vercel Functions automatically retry failed requests

# 4. If persistent: Implement connection pooling fix
# Supabase already provides pgBouncer pooling
# No manual action needed for typical cases

# 5. Monitor connection recovery
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health
# Should return 200 within 1-2 minutes

# 6. If still failing after 5 min:
# Upgrade Supabase compute add-on for more connections
# Dashboard → Project → Database → Settings → Compute Size
```

**Expected timeline:**

- Automatic recovery: 1-2 minutes
- Supabase compute upgrade: 5-10 minutes
- Service verification: 2-3 minutes
- **Total: 1-15 minutes**

---

### TRIAGE C: Slow Queries or High Load ✓

```bash
# This means DATABASE is responsive but slow

echo "✓ INVESTIGATION MODE - Slow Query Analysis"

# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (< 5 min):

# 1. Find slow queries
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT query_start, duration, query
  FROM pg_stat_statements
  WHERE mean_time > 5000  -- longer than 5 seconds
  ORDER BY mean_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"

# 2. Explain expensive queries
# Example:
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM shipment s JOIN driver d ON s.driver_id = d.id;"
# Look for: Full table scans, N+1 queries

# 3. Check for table locks
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
  SELECT blocked_locks.pid, blocked_locks.query,
         blocking_locks.pid, blocking_locks.query
  FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
  JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted AND blocked_locks.pid != blocking_locks.pid;
"

# 4. Monitor in real-time
watch -n 1 'psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT namespaces.nspname, tables.relname, statio.heap_blks_read, statio.heap_blks_hit FROM pg_stat_user_tables statio JOIN pg_class tables ON statio.relid = tables.oid JOIN pg_namespace namespaces ON tables.relnamespace = namespaces.oid ORDER BY statio.heap_blks_read DESC LIMIT 5;"'

# 5. Enable query logging for investigation
# In postgresql.conf:
log_min_duration_statement = 1000  # Log queries > 1 second
# OR modify Supabase logging settings

# 6. Deploy performance fix
# Add indexes: CREATE INDEX idx_shipment_driver_id ON shipment(driver_id);
# Or refactor N+1 queries
# Or add database caching

# 7. Monitor improvement
watch -n 5 'curl -s https://your-domain.com/api/health | jq .response_time'
```

**Expected timeline:**

- Identify slow query: 3-5 minutes
- Deploy fix: 5-15 minutes (requires new deployment)
- Verify improvement: 2-3 minutes
- **Total: 15-30 minutes**

## Progressive Recovery (Supabase Only)

**If standard steps don't worky, escalate:**

### Level 1: Supabase Connection Pool Reset

```bash
# Supabase dashboard will automatically handle this
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[ID]/logs
# Monitor connection pool recovery
# Usually recovers within 1-2 minutes
```

### Level 2: Supabase Compute Upgrade

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# Project → Database → Settings → Compute Size
# Upgrade to higher tier for more connections
# Takes 3-5 minutes to apply
```

### Level 3: Supabase Cluster Restart

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# Project → Settings → Infrastructure
# Click "Restart Postgres" button
# Estimated downtime: 2-5 minutes
# Use only if database is unresponsive
```

### Level 4: Restore from Backup

```bash
# Last resort - restore from backup
# Estimated downtime: 30-60 minutes
# Data loss: All changes since last backup

# Supabase: https://supabase.com/dashboard → Backups
# Find backup from before issue
# Click "Restore"
# Confirm (cannot be undone)
```

---

## Prevention Going Forward

**After recovery, implement:**

```bash
# 1. Add monitoring
# Alert when connections > 80% capacity
# Alert when query latency > 5s

# 2. Add connection pooling
# Use PgBouncer: https://github.com/pgbouncer/pgbouncer
# Reduces connection overhead

# 3. Optimize queries
# Add indexes for WHERE/JOIN clauses
# Add SELECT specific columns (not SELECT *)
# Add LIMIT to prevent huge result sets

# 4. Enable auto-scaling
# For Supabase: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons
# Auto-scales compute based on demand

# 5. Configure alerts
# Sentry: Alert on database errors
# Monitoring: Alert on connection pool usage
# Custom: Alert on query latency spikes

# 6. Load test
# Before production deployment, test with load
# Verify queries perform under load
# Check connection pool behavior
```
