## A/B Testing Framework

### Testing Infrastructure

```
TOOLS:
  • Amplitude (product analytics): $995/month
  • Optimizely or LaunchDarkly (experimentation platform): $1,000-3,000/month
  • Feature flags (in-app configuration)

PROCESS:
  1. Hypothesis → Design experiment
  2. Implement feature flag (control vs treatment)
  3. Run 2-4 weeks (gather data)
  4. Analyze results (statistical significance)
  5. Launch winner or iterate
```

### Example Experiments (2026)

```
EXPERIMENT 1: Onboarding Flow Optimization

Hypothesis: "Adding a cost calculator on Day 2 increases feature adoption"

Control (A):
  • Day 1: Welcome email
  • Day 2: Report feature email
  • Day 3: Upgrade offer

Treatment (B):
  • Day 1: Welcome email
  • Day 2: Cost calculator email (NEW)
  • Day 3: Upgrade offer

Metrics:
  • Conversion rate (trial → paid)
  • Cost calculator adoption
  • Time-to-value

Duration: 2 weeks
Sample size: 1,000 new users per variant

Result hypothesis: Treatment B converts 25% higher (25% → 31%)
Decision: If +25% → Rollout to all, if flat → Iterate

---

EXPERIMENT 2: Feature Pricing (Expansion)

Hypothesis: "Bundling integrations increases adoption vs à la carte pricing"

Control (A): À la carte pricing
  • Each integration: $50/month
  • Setup time: 2 hours

Treatment (B): Bundle pricing
  • 5 integrations: $150/month (vs $250 à la carte)
  • Setup time: 30 minutes (simplified)

Metrics:
  • % of customers purchasing integrations
  • Integration setup time
  • ARR expansion per customer

Duration: 4 weeks
Sample size: 500 customers per variant

Result hypothesis: Treatment B increases adoption 30% and ARR expansion 50%
Decision: If true → Switch to bundle pricing, if flat → Keep pricing as-is

---

EXPERIMENT 3: Onboarding Tutorials (Activation)

Hypothesis: "Video tutorials increase feature adoption vs text tutorials"

Control (A): Text-based tutorials
  • Step-by-step guides
  • Screenshots
  • Estimated time: 5 minutes

Treatment (B): Video tutorials
  • 2-minute videos per feature
  • Interactive walkthrough
  • Estimated time: 2 minutes

Metrics:
  • Tutorial completion rate
  • Feature adoption rate
  • Time-to-first-use

Duration: 2 weeks
Sample size: 500 new users per variant

Result hypothesis: Treatment B completes 40% more often, features adopted 50% faster
Decision: If true → Migrate all tutorials to video, if flat → Hybrid approach
```

## Roadmap Prioritization Framework

### Feature Scoring Matrix

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  FEATURE PRIORITIZATION MATRIX                           ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

SCORE CALCULATION: (Impact + Confidence) × Ease

IMPACT (0-10 scale):
  • High-impact: +3-4 (increases churn, increases expansion, drives adoption)
  • Medium-impact: +2 (improves feature adoption or retention)
  • Low-impact: +1 (nice-to-have, requested by <5 customers)

CONFIDENCE (0-10 scale):
  • High (8-10): Data-backed by user research, analytics, competitors
  • Medium (5-7): Good hypothesis but limited validation
  • Low (2-4): Hypothesis only, needs more research

EASE (0-10 scale):
  • Quick wins (8-10): 1-2 weeks engineering effort
  • Medium (5-7): 2-4 weeks engineering effort
  • Complex (2-4): 4+ weeks engineering effort

PRIORITIZATION EXAMPLES:

Candidate A: "Advanced Reporting"
  • Impact: 7 (high-impact for retention, requested by top 20 customers)
  • Confidence: 8 (user research validates)
  • Ease: 5 (4 weeks engineering)
  • Score: (7+8) × 5 = 75 ✅ PRIORITY #1

Candidate B: "Mobile App"
  • Impact: 6 (nice-to-have for on-the-go)
  • Confidence: 4 (unvalidated, <10 requests)
  • Ease: 2 (12+ weeks engineering)
  • Score: (6+4) × 2 = 20 ❌ DEPRIORITIZE

Candidate C: "API Webhooks"
  • Impact: 9 (enables ecosystem, partnerships)
  • Confidence: 7 (top 10 customers want it)
  • Ease: 6 (3 weeks engineering)
  • Score: (9+7) × 6 = 96 ✅ PRIORITY #2

Roadmap (Q1-Q4 2026):
  1. Advanced Reporting (Q1)
  2. API Webhooks (Q2)
  3. Integration Marketplace (Q3)
  4. Mobile Progressive Web App (Q4)
  5. [Deprioritize] Mobile native app
