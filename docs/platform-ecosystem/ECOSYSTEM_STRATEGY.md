## Ecosystem Vision

### Why Ecosystem?

```
PROBLEM: "Infamous Freight is great for tracking, but we need accounting integration"
  • Customer wants to use Infamous + QuickBooks
  • Currently: Manual CSV exports → Manual data entry
  • Outcome: Customer churns (problem unsolved)

SOLUTION: Build ecosystem (API + marketplace)
  • Customers can connect Infamous ↔ QuickBooks automatically
  • Outcome: Customer happy, Infamous becomes central platform
  • Revenue: Additional $50/month per customer (10% expansion)

ECOSYSTEM REVENUE:
  • 500 customers × $50/month = $25K/month new ARR
  • 1000 customers × $50/month = $50K/month new ARR
  • Target: 30% adoption = $150K-300K/year ecosystem revenue
