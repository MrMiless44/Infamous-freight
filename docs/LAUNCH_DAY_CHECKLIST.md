## Monitoring During Launch (First Hour is Critical)

**Watch these metrics every 5 minutes:**

| Metric         | Good    | Warning   | Alert   |
| -------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Error Rate     | < 0.05% | 0.05-0.1% | > 0.1%  |
| P95 Latency    | < 200ms | 200-500ms | > 500ms |
| CPU            | < 50%   | 50-75%    | > 75%   |
| Memory         | < 60%   | 60-80%    | > 80%   |
| DB Connections | 5-15    | 15-20     | > 20    |

---

## If Issues Arise

### Error Rate Spiking (> 0.5%)

1. Check logs: `kubectl logs deployment/api --tail=100`
2. Identify error type (database, timeout, validation, etc.)
3. **Decision point:**
   - If quick fix possible (< 5 min): Fix & redeploy
   - If unclear: **ROLLBACK** (see below)

### Latency High (P95 > 1000ms)

1. Check database slow query logs
2. Check external service latencies (Stripe, etc.)
3. Scale up if needed: `kubectl scale deployment/api --replicas=5`
4. Monitor for 10 minutes, then rollback if not improving

### Database Connection Pool Exhausted

1. Check number of connections:
   `kubectl exec -it pod -- psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"`
2. Increase pool size in config
3. Restart pods: `kubectl rollout restart deployment/api`

### Complete Rollback

```bash
# 1. Immediate: Route traffic back to previous version
kubectl set image deployment/api api=YOUR_REGISTRY/infamous-freight-api:0.9.0
kubectl rollout status deployment/api --timeout=5m

# 2. Database: Restore from backup (if schema changed)
kubectl exec -it deployment/api -- psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql

# 3. Verify: Run smoke tests again
# See "Smoke Tests" section of DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK_KUBERNETES.md

# 4. Communicate: Update status page
# Status: "Investigating" → "Investigating an issue"
# Timeline: Document rollback time

# 5. Post-mortem: Within 24 hours
# - What went wrong?
# - Why wasn't it caught in testing?
# - How do we prevent this?
```

## Communication During Launch

### Every 30 Minutes (Status Updates)
