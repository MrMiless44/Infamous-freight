# Audit Policy - Infæmous Freight

**Effective Date:** January 16, 2026  
**Version:** 1.0 (Phase 18)

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes requirements for audit logging, retention, and
verification to ensure:

- **Non-repudiation:** Users cannot deny actions they performed
- **Compliance:** SOC2-lite auditability requirements met
- **Tamper detection:** Hash chaining prevents unauthorized modifications
- **Incident investigation:** Complete record for root cause analysis

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All API requests and responses
- Authentication events (success and failure)
- Authorization decisions (grants and denials)
- Data modifications (create, update, delete)
- Administrative actions
- Security-relevant events (rate limits, CSP violations, auth failures)

## 3. Audit Trail Requirements

### 3.1 Mandatory Fields

Every audit entry MUST include:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-01-16T12:34:56.789Z",
  "id": "audit-uuid",
  "prevHash": "previous_entry_hash_or_genesis",
  "hash": "sha256_of_this_entry",
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/api/jobs/accept",
    "ip": "192.0.2.1",
    "userAgent": "curl/7.64"
  },
  "response": {
    "statusCode": 200,
    "duration": 145
  },
  "actor": {
    "userId": "user-123",
    "role": "SHIPPER",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "action": "job:accept",
  "resource": {
    "type": "Job",
    "id": "job-456"
  },
  "result": "success",
  "context": {
    "tags": ["phase-18", "audit"],
    "extra": {}
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Hash Chain Integrity

- **Algorithm:** SHA256
- **Input:** Previous hash + current entry JSON + audit salt
- **Verification:** `verifyJobAuditChain(jobId)` validates linkage
- **Tampering Detection:** Any modification breaks hash chain

```javascript
// Example verification
const result = await verifyJobAuditChain("job-123", prisma);
if (!result.ok) {
  console.log("TAMPERING DETECTED:", result.tampering);
  // Possible values: "BROKEN_CHAIN", "DATA_MODIFIED"
}
```

## 4. Log Retention

| Log Type        | Retention | Storage          | Rotation  |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| API access      | 90 days   | Hot (searchable) | Weekly    |
| Audit chain     | 1 year    | Archive (cold)   | Monthly   |
| Error logs      | 30 days   | Sentry           | Automatic |
| Security events | 1 year    | Archive + Sentry | Monthly   |

- **Backup:** Audit logs backed up daily (immutable storage)
- **Deletion:** After retention expires, logs archived to cold storage (no
  deletion)

## 5. Audit Log Verification

### 5.1 Automated Verification

Verification runs:

- **On-demand:** `POST /api/audit/verify` (admin only)
- **Scheduled:** Daily at 02:00 UTC (random sample)
- **On access:** Before returning job event history

### 5.2 Verification Process

```bash
# Example: Verify single job
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.infamous-freight.com/api/audit/verify \
  -d '{"jobId": "job-123"}'

# Response
{
  "ok": true,
  "checked": 47,
  "jobId": "job-123",
  "verified": "2026-01-16T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 5.3 Tampering Response

If tampering detected:

1. **Immediate:** Alert security team via Sentry
2. **Investigation:** Run full chain verification on related records
3. **Notification:** Notify affected parties within 1 hour
4. **Remediation:** Rollback to last known good state from backup
5. **Prevention:** Add additional controls if needed
