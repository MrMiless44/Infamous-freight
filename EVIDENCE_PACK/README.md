## Usage

### For Audits

1. Share appropriate files with auditors/customers
2. Redact sensitive data (IPs, internal hostnames, user details)
3. Include attestations of procedures followed
4. Provide verification scripts (e.g., `verify_headers.sh`)

### For CI/CD Integration

```bash
# Generate evidence artifacts
pnpm generate:evidence

# Verify audit chain integrity
node apps/api/src/audit/verify.js --jobId=<JOB_ID>

# Collect security headers
curl -i https://api.infamous-freight.com/api/health
```

### Compliance Checklist

## Updating Evidence

Update artifacts regularly:

1. **Weekly**
   - Refresh audit log samples
   - Update security event summary
   - Check Sentry error trends

2. **Monthly**
   - Run security headers verification
   - Audit RBAC configuration
   - Verify audit chain integrity (random sample)

3. **Quarterly**
   - Full dependency audit
   - Incident response test
   - Security assessment review

## Security Notes

- ⚠️ Redact all production data before sharing
- ⚠️ Remove internal IPs and hostnames
- ⚠️ Do not include real encryption keys
- ✅ Include timestamps for all evidence
- ✅ Sign critical artifacts (GPG) if required
- ✅ Maintain chain of custody for audit logs
