## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small**
- Deploy to staging first (not production)
- Use minimal infrastructure initially
- Scale based on real traffic patterns

### 2. **Monitor Early**
- Set up monitoring before launch (not after)
- Create dashboards immediately
- Define alert thresholds upfront

### 3. **Automate Everything**
- CI/CD saves hours (set up first week)
- Automated backups prevent disasters
- Health checks catch issues fast

### 4. **Document Decisions**
- Update runbooks as you learn
- Record why you made technical choices
- Create incident response checklists

### 5. **Test Thoroughly**
- Load test before production (10K+ requests)
- Security audit before launch
- Practice rollback 3+ times
