## The "Bus Factor" Problem

### Current Risk Assessment

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  BUS FACTOR ANALYSIS (Jan 2026)                          ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

SYSTEM/AREA             PRIMARY EXPERT   BACKUP   BUS FACTOR
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Database Architecture   Engineer A       None     🔴 1
API Design Patterns     Engineer B       Eng C    🟡 2
Authentication System   Engineer B       Eng D    🟡 2
AI Integration          Engineer C       None     🔴 1
Deployment Pipeline     Engineer D       Eng E    🟡 2
Frontend Architecture   Engineer E       None     🔴 1
Mobile App              Engineer E       None     🔴 1
Billing Integration     Engineer A       None     🔴 1

RISK LEVEL: 🔴 HIGH (5 critical areas with bus factor 1)

BUS FACTOR DEFINITION:
  • 1 = Critical risk (only 1 person knows)
  • 2 = Moderate risk (2 people know)
  • 3+ = Low risk (knowledge distributed)

GOAL: All critical systems with bus factor ≥3 by Q3 2026
```

### Why This Matters

```
SCENARIOS:
  ❌ Engineer leaves → 6 weeks to ramp replacement
  ❌ Engineer on vacation → blocked work
  ❌ Engineer sick → delayed incident response
  ❌ Scaling team → slow onboarding (2-3 months)

IMPACT:
  • Slower development velocity
  • Higher risk of outages
  • Difficult to scale team
  • Knowledge lost permanently
  • New engineers frustrated
```

#### System Documentation

**Location**: `docs/systems/`

**Systems to Document**:

##### 1. Authentication & Authorization (`docs/systems/auth.md`)

```markdown
# Authentication & Authorization System

## Overview
How users authenticate and what they're authorized to do.

## Components
- JWT token generation (api/src/middleware/security.js)
- Scope-based authorization
- Token refresh mechanism
- Password hashing (bcrypt, 12 rounds)

## Authentication Flow
[Sequence diagram]

1. User submits email/password
2. API validates credentials (bcrypt compare)
3. Generate JWT (expires 1 hour)
4. Generate refresh token (expires 7 days)
5. Return both tokens to client

## Authorization Flow
[Sequence diagram]

1. Client sends request with JWT (Bearer token)
2. Middleware validates JWT (authenticate())
3. Middleware checks scopes (requireScope())
4. Request proceeds if authorized

## Common Scopes
- user:profile (view own profile)
- user:avatar (upload avatar)
- shipment:read (view shipments)
- shipment:write (create/edit shipments)
- admin:* (all admin operations)
- ai:command (use AI features)
- voice:ingest (upload voice files)
- billing:read (view billing info)

## Troubleshooting
**Issue**: "Invalid or expired token"
**Solution**: Check JWT_SECRET, token expiration, clock skew

**Issue**: "Insufficient scope"
**Solution**: Verify user has required scope, check token payload

## Code References
- Authentication: api/src/middleware/security.js#authenticate
- Authorization: api/src/middleware/security.js#requireScope
- Token generation: api/src/routes/auth.js#login
```

##### 2. Database Architecture (`docs/systems/database.md`)

```markdown
# Database Architecture

## Overview
PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM, primary + 2 read replicas.

## Schema
[Link to schema.prisma]

### Key Tables
- users: User accounts and profiles
- shipments: Core shipment data
- drivers: Driver information
- audit_logs: Audit trail for compliance

## Relationships
[Entity-relationship diagram]

## Query Patterns
### Common Queries
- Find shipment by ID: shipments.findUnique({ where: { id } })
- List user shipments: shipments.findMany({ where: { userId } })
- Search shipments: [complex query example]

### Performance Tips
- Use `include` to avoid N+1 queries
- Add indexes for filtered fields
- Use read replicas for heavy reads
- Cache frequent queries (Redis)

## Migrations
- Location: api/prisma/migrations/
- Create: pnpm prisma:migrate:dev --name <name>
- Apply: pnpm prisma:migrate:deploy
- Rollback: [steps]

## Backup & Restore
- Automated daily backups (3am UTC)
- Retention: 30 days
- Restore: [procedure]

## Troubleshooting
**Issue**: "Connection pool exhausted"
**Solution**: Increase pool size, check for connection leaks

**Issue**: "Migration failed"
**Solution**: [rollback steps]

## Code References
- Schema: api/prisma/schema.prisma
- Client setup: api/src/config/prisma.js
- Example queries: api/src/services/*.js
```

##### 3-10. Additional Systems

```
3. API Design & Best Practices (docs/systems/api.md)
4. Caching Strategy (docs/systems/caching.md)
5. Deployment Pipeline (docs/systems/deployment.md)
6. Monitoring & Alerting (docs/systems/monitoring.md)
7. Error Handling (docs/systems/error-handling.md)
8. Feature Flags (docs/systems/feature-flags.md)
9. Rate Limiting (docs/systems/rate-limiting.md)
10. Background Jobs (docs/systems/background-jobs.md)

TARGET: 10 system docs by end of Q1 2026
```

---

#### Runbooks (Incident Response)

**Location**: `docs/runbooks/`

**Template**:
```markdown
# Runbook: [Incident Type]

## Symptoms
[What the user/monitoring sees]
- Symptom 1
- Symptom 2

## Impact
[What's broken, how many users affected]

## Triage (First 5 Minutes)
1. Confirm scope (how many users?)
2. Check monitoring dashboard
3. Review recent deployments (rollback candidate?)
4. Escalate if P0/P1

## Investigation
1. Check logs: [where to look]
2. Check metrics: [which graphs]
3. Check dependencies: [external services]

## Resolution Steps
### Option 1: Rollback (fastest)
[Exact commands]

### Option 2: Quick fix
[Exact commands]

### Option 3: Full fix
[Longer-term solution]

## Verification
- [ ] Monitoring shows recovery
- [ ] Error rate back to normal
- [ ] Sample user requests succeeding
- [ ] No alerts firing

## Follow-Up
- [ ] Post-mortem (within 48 hours)
- [ ] Update runbook if needed
- [ ] Prevent recurrence (tech debt ticket)

## Code References
[Links to relevant code]
```

### Documentation Debt Tracking

**Add to Sprint Planning**:
```
JUST LIKE TECH DEBT, TRACK "DOCS DEBT":
  • Missing documentation for new features
  • Outdated docs (after refactoring)
  • Missing runbooks (after incidents)

ALLOCATE TIME: 5% of sprint capacity (2.5 dev-days/sprint)
  • Update docs after shipping features
  • Create runbooks after incidents
  • Record videos quarterly
```
