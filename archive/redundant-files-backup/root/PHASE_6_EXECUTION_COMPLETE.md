**Backup Strategy:**

```
Daily at 2 AM UTC:     Full backup → S3 (encrypted)

Weekly cleanup:         Delete backups older than 30 days
```

**Impact:**

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Enable Connection Pooling

```bash
# Update DATABASE_URL in .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db?connection_limit=20&schema=public

# Validate on startup
node -e "const { validateDatabaseConnection } = require('./apps/api/src/config/database'); const { prisma } = require('./apps/api/src/db/prisma'); validateDatabaseConnection(prisma);"
```

### 2. Start Message Queue Workers

```javascript
// In apps/api/src/server.js, add at startup:
const {
  initializeSchedulers,
  startEmailWorker,
  startWebhookWorker,
  startAuditWorker,
  startBatchWorker,
} = require("./services/queue");

initializeSchedulers();
startEmailWorker();
startWebhookWorker();
startAuditWorker();
startBatchWorker();
```

### 3. Enable Audit Logging

```javascript
// In apps/api/src/server.js middleware stack:
const { auditMiddleware } = require("./services/audit");
app.use("/api", auditMiddleware);
```

### 4. Access Swagger UI

```bash
pnpm dev
# Visit: http://localhost:4000/api-docs
```

### 5. Configure Backups

```env
# Add to .env
BACKUP_S3_BUCKET=infamous-freight-backups
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=30
```
