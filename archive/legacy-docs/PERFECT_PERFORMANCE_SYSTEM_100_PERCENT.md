## 🔄 Integrated Workflow

### Phase 1: Development (Day 1-3)

**1. Plan Route**

```
- Define HTTP method & path
- Identify required scope
- Estimate payload size
- Plan code splitting strategy
```

**2. Build Perfect Route**

```javascript
// Use template from ROUTE_BUILDING_MASTER_SYSTEM_100_PERCENT.md
// Copy appropriate pattern (Create, Read, List, Update, Delete, Advanced)
// Keep middleware stack intact (all 13 recommendations)
```

**3. Optimize Bundle**

```
- Check route dependencies
- Ensure tree-shaking enabled
- Lazy-load heavy imports
- Validate shared package usage
```

**4. Implement Code Splitting**

```
- Use dynamic imports for large handlers
- Split service dependencies
- Configure lazy service loading
- Enable route-level splitting
```

**5. Add Tests**

```javascript
// Use templates from guide:
// - Validation tests (Rec 6)
// - Auth/authorization tests (Rec 4)
// - Rate limiting tests (Rec 5)
// - Query optimization tests (Rec 7)
// - Error handling tests (Rec 11)
// - Happy path test
// Target: >75% coverage (Rec 2)
```

### Phase 2: Quality Assurance (Day 4)

**1. Pre-Submission Checklist**

```
✅ Security (Rec 4, 5, 6, 13)
✅ Performance (Rec 3, 7, 9)
✅ Code Quality (Rec 1, 2, 3)
✅ Monitoring (Rec 11, 12, 13)
✅ Documentation (Rec 2, 3)
```

**2. Bundle Analysis**

```bash
cd apps/web
ANALYZE=true pnpm build
# Verify < 150KB gzipped
# Check vendor splits
# Validate tree-shaking
```

**3. Code Splitting Verification**

```bash
# Verify route chunks created
# Confirm lazy loading working
# Check shared package split
# Validate caching headers
```

**4. Performance Testing**

```bash
pnpm test -- --coverage
# Must be > 75%

pnpm check:types
# Zero errors

pnpm lint
# No warnings
```

### Phase 3: Deployment (Day 5)

**1. Staging Deploy**

```bash
# 1. Build with analysis
ANALYZE=true pnpm build

# 2. Start monitoring
tail -f logs/combined.log

# 3. Run smoke tests
pnpm test:smoke

# 4. Check Sentry (if errors)
# Login to sentry.io
```

**2. Production Deploy**

```bash
# 1. Tag release
git tag -a v1.0.0

# 2. Deploy to production
pnpm deploy:production

# 3. Monitor metrics
# - Response time (p95 < 500ms)
# - Error rate (< 0.1%)
# - Bundle size (< 150KB)

# 4. Verify logs
# All requests logged properly
```
