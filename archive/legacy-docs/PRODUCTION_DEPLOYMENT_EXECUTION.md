**Status**: ✅ READY TO EXECUTE  
**Timeline**: 2 hours total  
**Environment**: Production (docker-compose.production.yml)  
**Authorization**: ✅ APPROVED

---

## ✅ PHASE 1: PRE-DEPLOYMENT (1 hour)

### **1.1 Go/No-Go Review** (15 minutes)

**Review Critical Checklist**:

```bash
# Read the complete go/no-go checklist
cat PRE_DEPLOYMENT_GO_NO_GO_CHECKLIST.md
# Verify all 70+ items passing
```

**Sign-off Required**:

- ✅ All local tests passing
- ✅ All health checks green
- ✅ All databases backed up
- ✅ All secrets configured
- ✅ Team availability confirmed
- ✅ Rollback plan understood
- ✅ Monitoring alerts configured
- ✅ Incident contacts ready

### **1.2 Secret Configuration** (15 minutes)

**Setup production secrets**:

```bash
# Navigate to production environment
cd /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises

# Option A: Using setup-secrets.sh script
bash scripts/setup-secrets.sh

# Option B: Manual setup
# Create secrets directory
mkdir -p /run/secrets

# Generate JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32 > /run/secrets/jwt_secret
chmod 600 /run/secrets/jwt_secret

# Generate database password
openssl rand -base64 32 > /run/secrets/db_password
chmod 600 /run/secrets/db_password

# Generate Redis password
openssl rand -base64 32 > /run/secrets/redis_password
chmod 600 /run/secrets/redis_password

# Copy other production secrets
cp .env.production /path/to/secrets/  # Requires manual setup
```

**Verify secrets loaded**:

```bash
ls -la /run/secrets/
# Should show:
# - jwt_secret
# - db_password
# - redis_password
# - [other production secrets]
```

### **1.3 Production Database Setup** (15 minutes)

**Initialize production database**:

```bash
# Option A: Using Prisma (if app setup)
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma:migrate:deploy

# Option B: Manual migrations
psql postgresql://infamous:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/infamous_freight < DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.sql

# Verify schema
psql postgresql://infamous:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/infamous_freight
\dt  # List tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shipments;
\q
```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ All tables created
- ✅ All indices present
- ✅ Schema version matches app
- ✅ No migration errors

### **1.4 Blue-Green Setup** (15 minutes)

**Prepare for zero-downtime deployment**:

```bash
# Assuming current live deployment is "blue"
# We'll deploy new version as "green"

# Step 1: Verify current "blue" health
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health  # Blue endpoint
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }

# Step 2: Prepare "green" environment
# Create new docker-compose instance for green
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml \
  -p infamous-green up -d

# Step 3: Verify "green" startup
sleep 30
curl http://localhost:8082/api/health  # Green endpoint
# Expected: { "status": "ok" }

# Step 4: Run health validation script
bash scripts/healthcheck.sh
# Should show both blue (8081) and green (8082) healthy
```

**Blue-Green Status**:

- 🔵 Blue (current): Port 8081 ✅ Running
- 🟢 Green (new): Port 8082 ✅ Running
- Nginx: Ready to switch traffic

---

## 🚀 PHASE 2: DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION (30 minutes)

### **2.1 Gradual Traffic Switch** (20 minutes)

**Zero-downtime switchover**:

```bash
# Step 1: Run deployment switch script
bash scripts/switch-deployment.sh

# Expected output:
# Verifying green health...
# ✅ Green is healthy
# Updating Nginx configuration...
# ✅ Nginx updated
# Performing graceful reload...
# ✅ Traffic switched to green
# Verifying traffic...
# ✅ Requests routing to green
# Deactivating blue...
# ✅ Blue scaled down

# Timeline of this script:
# - Health checks: 2-3 minutes
# - Config updates: 1-2 minutes
# - Graceful reload: 1-2 minutes
# - Verification: 2-3 minutes
# Total: ~8-10 minutes
```

**Monitor During Switch**:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch request counts
watch -n 1 'curl http://localhost/api/health | jq .requests_processed'

# Terminal 2: Watch error rates
watch -n 1 'curl http://localhost/api/health/details | jq .error_rate'

# Terminal 3: Check logs
docker logs -f infamous-green-api-1

# Success indicators:
# ✅ Request count increasing
# ✅ Error rate stable/decreasing
# ✅ No 5xx errors in logs
```

### **2.2 Post-Switch Validation** (10 minutes)

**Verify deployment successful**:

```bash
# Test all critical endpoints on new version
curl -X GET http://localhost/api/health
curl -X GET http://localhost/api/health/live
curl -X GET http://localhost/api/health/ready

# Test API functionality
TEST_JWT="[production-jwt]"
curl -X GET http://localhost/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_JWT"

curl -X GET http://localhost/api/shipments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_JWT"

# Check response times
time curl http://localhost/api/shipments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_JWT"
# Expected: <200ms response time

# Verify database operations
# Create test shipment
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/shipments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"origin":"NYC","destination":"LA","weight":500}'
# Expected: 201 Created
```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ All endpoints responding (200/201)
- ✅ No 500 errors
- ✅ Response times <200ms
- ✅ Database writes working
- ✅ Authentication working

---

## ✅ PHASE 3: POST-DEPLOYMENT (30 minutes)

### **3.1 Monitoring Verification** (10 minutes)

**Check all monitoring systems**:

```bash
# 1. Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets | jq '.data.activeTargets[] | {labels, health}'
# Should show all targets with health: "up"

# 2. Grafana dashboards
open http://localhost:3001
# Login: admin / admin
# Check 5 dashboards:
#   ✅ API Performance (metrics present)
#   ✅ Database Health (connections normal)
#   ✅ Infrastructure (CPU/memory normal)
#   ✅ Blue-Green Deployment (green active)
#   ✅ API Dashboard (request rates)

# 3. Alert rules
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules | jq '.data.groups[] | .rules[] | {name, state}'
# Should show firing rules if any alerts triggered
# Expected: 0 critical alerts
```

### **3.2 Application Health Check** (10 minutes)

**Comprehensive health validation**:

```bash
# Run the provided health check script
bash scripts/healthcheck.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ PostgreSQL: Connected
# ✅ Redis: Connected
# ✅ API: Healthy
# ✅ Web: Healthy
# All services healthy. Production deployment successful!

# Manual health checks:
# PostgreSQL
psql postgresql://infamous:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/infamous_freight \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM users;"

# Redis
redis-cli -a redispass PING
# Expected: PONG

# API endpoints
for endpoint in /health /health/live /health/ready; do
  echo "Testing $endpoint"
  curl -s http://localhost:80/api$endpoint | jq .
done
```

### **3.3 24-Hour Monitoring Plan** (10 minutes)

**Establish ongoing monitoring**:

```bash
# 1. Set up automated health checks
# Create cron job
crontab -e

# Add these lines:
*/5 * * * * bash /path/to/scripts/healthcheck.sh >> /var/log/health-checks.log

# Every 5 minutes: health check
# Every hour: detailed metrics report
# 24/7: error rate monitoring

# 2. Configure alerts
# These should already be in Prometheus:
# - Error rate > 1% (critical)
# - Response time > 500ms (warning)
# - Database connections > 80% pool (warning)
# - Disk space < 10% (critical)

# 3. Set up incident escalation
# See: INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md
# Contacts:
# - On-call engineer: [phone]
# - Escalation: [manager-phone]
# - Page duty: [pagerduty-email]

# 4. Run first 24-hour monitoring
# Schedule team for:
# - Hour 1: Active monitoring (everyone)
# - Hour 6: Check in and review logs
# - Hour 24: Full health report and sign-off
```
