# Phase 1 — Marketplace Foundation (100% Complete)

## 📋 Overview

Phase 1 establishes the core marketplace primitives for a DoorDash-style
delivery platform. After Phase 1, you can:

✅ Create shippers and drivers with role-based permissions  
✅ Driver posts location (GPS) and vehicle capabilities  
✅ Shipper creates a job (starts in DRAFT status)  
✅ System matches eligible drivers by vehicle type, capacity, and radius  
✅ Driver accepts job, progresses through delivery workflow

**No Stripe integration yet** — Phase 2 adds payment processing.

## 📍 Geolocation Utilities

**File**: [apps/api/src/lib/geo.ts](../apps/api/src/lib/geo.ts)

**Functions**:

```typescript
// Calculate distance between two points using Haversine formula
export function milesBetween(
  lat1: number, lon1: number,
  lat2: number, lon2: number
): number { ... }

// Check if driver is within radius of job pickup
export function isWithinRadius(
  driverLat: number, driverLng: number,
  jobLat: number, jobLng: number,
  radiusMiles: number
): boolean { ... }

// Filter drivers by radius
export function filterByRadius(
  drivers: DriverLocation[],
  pickupLat: number, pickupLng: number,
  radiusMiles: number
): DriverLocation[] { ... }
```

✅ **Status**: Geo utilities implemented with Haversine distance calculation

---

## ✅ Zod Validators

**File**:
[apps/api/src/marketplace/validators.ts](../apps/api/src/marketplace/validators.ts)

**Schemas**:

- `createUserSchema` — Email, name, role (SHIPPER|DRIVER|ADMIN)
- `upsertDriverProfileSchema` — User ID, active status
- `updateDriverLocationSchema` — Coordinates (lat/lng)
- `addVehicleSchema` — Vehicle type, weight/volume limits
- `createJobSchema` — Pickup/dropoff addresses & coords, vehicle requirements,
  weight, volume
- `matchDriversSchema` — Job ID, search radius (default 50 miles)
- `acceptJobSchema` — Job & driver IDs
- `updateJobStatusSchema` — New job status

All schemas include TypeScript type exports for IDE support.

✅ **Status**: All validators created with proper error messages

## 🔐 Authentication & Scopes

All endpoints except `POST /marketplace/users` require JWT authentication.

**Required Scopes**:

- `driver:profile` — Create/update driver profile
- `driver:location` — Update GPS location
- `driver:vehicles` — Add vehicles
- `driver:jobs` — Accept jobs
- `shipper:jobs` — Create jobs
- `shipper:matching` — Query driver matching
- `shipper:checkout` — Proceed to Stripe checkout (Phase 2)

**Example JWT Header**:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## 📊 Data Flow Example

### Complete Workflow: Shipper → Driver Match → Acceptance

```
1. Shipper creates account
   POST /marketplace/users
   → User created with role=SHIPPER

2. Driver creates account & profile
   POST /marketplace/users (role=DRIVER)
   POST /marketplace/driver-profiles
   → DriverProfile created

3. Driver adds vehicle
   POST /marketplace/vehicles
   → Vehicle created (BOX_TRUCK, 10000 lbs, 500 cu ft)

4. Driver updates location (background, periodic)
   PUT /marketplace/driver-profiles/{userId}/location
   → lastLat, lastLng, lastLocationAt updated

5. Shipper creates a job
   POST /marketplace/jobs
   → Job created in DRAFT status
   → estimatedMiles calculated (Haversine)
   → estimatedMinutes calculated (~30 mph)

6. Shipper publishes job for matching
   PATCH /marketplace/jobs/{jobId}/status
   → Status transitions to OPEN

7. Shipper finds eligible drivers
   POST /marketplace/jobs/{jobId}/match-drivers
   → Filter drivers by:
     • Vehicle type matches (BOX_TRUCK)
     • Vehicle capacity >= job needs (10000 lbs)
     • Distance <= 50 miles
   → Return sorted by distance (closest first)

8. Driver accepts job
   POST /marketplace/jobs/{jobId}/accept
   → Job status → ACCEPTED
   → driverId linked to job

9. Driver progresses through workflow
   PATCH /marketplace/jobs/{jobId}/status
   → PICKED_UP → DELIVERED → COMPLETED
```
