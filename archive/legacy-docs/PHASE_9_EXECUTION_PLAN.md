---

## Phase 9.1: DEPLOYMENT (Days 1-2)

### Task 1.1: Pre-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Check all systems are ready
bash ./deploy.sh --preflight-only

# Verify:
# ✓ All tests passing (60+)
# ✓ Build pipeline successful
# ✓ Code reviewed
# ✓ Environment configured
# ✓ Backup strategy ready
```

### Task 1.2: Deploy API to Production

```bash
# Full deployment with monitoring
bash ./deploy.sh

# Monitors:
# - Preflight checks
# - Build verification
# - Git push (triggers CI/CD)
# - Fly.io deployment
# - Health checks
# - Post-deployment validation
```

### Task 1.3: Validate Production Health

```bash
# Check API responsiveness
curl -i https://api.fly.dev/api/health

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# {
#   "status": "ok",
#   "uptime": 1234,
#   "database": "connected"
# }

# Monitor logs
flyctl logs -a infamous-freight-api

# Watch for:
# - No 5xx errors
# - Response times < 500ms
# - Database queries < 100ms
```

---

## Phase 9.2: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Days 3-6)

### Task 2.1: Implement Redis Caching

**Review existing setup:**

```bash
cat apps/api/src/lib/redis.ts
```

**Integration steps:**

1. Add Redis client to Express middleware
2. Cache shipment list endpoints
3. Implement cache invalidation
4. Test cache hit rates

**Expected metrics:**

- Response time reduced 40-60%
- Database load reduced 30-50%
- Support 3x more concurrent users
- Cost savings: ~$500/month

### Task 2.2: Run Load Testing

```bash
# Run complete load test suite
K6_TOKEN=$JWT k6 run load-test.k6.js

# Scenarios:
# 1. Baseline (10 users, 5 min)
# 2. Ramp-up (10→50→100 users)
# 3. Sustained (100 users, 15 min)
# 4. Spike (100→500 users)

# Success criteria:
# ✓ P50 < 200ms
# ✓ P95 < 500ms
# ✓ P99 < 1000ms
# ✓ Error rate < 0.1%
# ✓ Throughput > 100 req/sec
```

### Task 2.3: Apply Database Indexes

```bash
# Connect to production database
flyctl ssh console -a infamous-freight-api

# Run optimization script
psql $DATABASE_URL < DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md

# Verify indexes created
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('shipments', 'drivers', 'users');

# Benchmark before/after with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM shipments
WHERE driver_id = '...' AND status = 'in_transit'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Indexes to create (see DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md):**

- `shipments(driverId, status, createdAt)`
- `shipments(organizationId, status)`
- `drivers(organizationId, isActive)`
- `users(email)` - UNIQUE
- `audit_logs(userId, createdAt)`
- 5+ additional context-specific indexes

**Expected improvements:**

- List queries: -80% execution time
- Filter queries: -90% execution time
- Join queries: -50% execution time
- Overall throughput: +200%

## Phase 9.3: SECURITY HARDENING (Days 7-8)

### Task 3.1: Run Security Audit

```bash
# Automated security scan
bash SECURITY_AUDIT.sh

# Manual checks:
# ✓ HTTPS enforced (Fly.io provides)
# ✓ CSP headers configured
# ✓ X-Frame-Options set
# ✓ CORS restricted to known origins
# ✓ Rate limits enforced
# ✓ No secrets in code (git history scan)
# ✓ Dependencies up-to-date
# ✓ SQL injection prevented (Prisma ORM)
```

### Task 3.2: Enable WAF Rules (Fly.io)

```bash
# Create WAF policy
flyctl waf create -a infamous-freight-api

# Enable rules:
# - OWASP Top 10
# - SQL injection detection
# - XSS protection
# - Rate limiting
# - Geo-blocking (optional)

# Expected protection:
# - Block 99% of common attacks
# - Zero false positives
# - <5ms latency added
```

### Task 3.3: Implement Secret Rotation

```bash
# Generate new JWT_SECRET
NEW_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Set in production
flyctl secrets set JWT_SECRET=$NEW_SECRET -a infamous-freight-api

# Configure rotation schedule:
# - Daily: Random check for exposure
# - Weekly: Planned rotation
# - Bi-weekly: Audit log review
# - Monthly: Incident review
```

---

## Phase 9.4: MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY (Days 3-4)

### Task 4.1: Activate Sentry Error Tracking

```bash
# Set Sentry DSN
SENTRY_DSN="https://key@sentry.io/project_id"
flyctl secrets set SENTRY_DSN=$SENTRY_DSN -a infamous-freight-api

# Create alert rules:
# ✓ New error spike (>5% increase)
# ✓ Critical errors (500, 503)
# ✓ Performance degradation (>2x baseline)

# Dashboard metrics:
# - Error count by route
# - Error rate over time
# - Top errors (histogram)
# - User impact
# - Resolution time
```

### Task 4.2: Configure Datadog APM

```bash
# Set Datadog credentials
flyctl secrets set DATADOG_API_KEY=$KEY -a infamous-freight-api
flyctl secrets set DATADOG_APP_KEY=$APP_KEY -a infamous-freight-api

# Initialize tracer in server.js
# Trace tags: route, user, organization

# Create dashboards:
# - Request latency by endpoint
# - Database query performance
# - Cache hit rates
# - Error rates by service
# - User experience (RUM)

# Configure alerts:
# ✓ P95 latency > 500ms
# ✓ Error rate > 1%
# ✓ Database connections > 90%
# ✓ Redis memory > 80%
```

### Task 4.3: Set Up PagerDuty Integration

```bash
# Connect monitoring to PagerDuty
# - Sentry → PagerDuty
# - Datadog → PagerDuty

# Define escalation policies:
# CRITICAL (immediate page):
#  - System down
#  - Error rate > 5%
#  - Response time > 5s
#
# HIGH (page within 5 min):
#  - Error rate > 1%
#  - Response time > 1s
#
# MEDIUM (daily digest):
#  - Trends, low-priority alerts

# Configure on-call schedules:
# - Primary (Mon-Fri business hours)
# - Secondary (weekends)
# - Escalation (if primary doesn't ack)
```

flyctl releases rollback -a infamous-freight-api
```

### Data Backup
