## 🔍 NEXT STEPS FOR TEAM

### Immediate (< 1 hour)

1. Monitor GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
   - Watch all 7 phases complete
   - Verify security scan passes
   - Confirm E2E tests pass
2. Check Vercel deployment
   - Web app deployed successfully
   - Health check responsive
3. Verify database migrations
   - Run `pnpm prisma:migrate:dev` to apply migrations locally
   - Check new indexes created

### Short-term (Today)

1. Enable caching middleware on API routes
   ```javascript
   // Add to relevant routes
   const cacheTTL = cacheMiddleware({ ttl: 300 }); // 5 minutes
   router.get("/shipments", cacheTTL, handler);
   ```
2. Enable JWT token rotation (production config)
   ```javascript
   // Set ENABLE_JWT_ROTATION=true in production .env
   ```
3. Test scope matrix with real users
   - Verify permission checks working
   - Audit scope enforcement

### Medium-term (This week)

1. Integrate bundle analysis into CI/CD
   - Review bundle size trends
   - Set performance budgets
2. Wire cache invalidation
   - Clear cache on data mutations
   - Test TTL expiration
3. Load test with performance benchmarks
   - Verify API response times < 100ms p95
   - Check database query performance

### Long-term (Ongoing)

1. Monitor database performance
   - Slow query log analysis
   - Index usage statistics
2. Track security metrics
   - Token rotation success rate
   - Scope enforcement violations
3. Optimize frontend bundle
   - Implement code splitting recommendations
   - Monitor LCP < 2.5s

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS & BEST PRACTICES

### Database Design

- Always add User relations for data ownership
- Use CASCADE DELETE for clean data consistency
- Index on frequently queried column combinations
- Performance indexes critical for scale

### Security

- Token rotation prevents replay attacks
- Scope-based auth > role-based auth
- OWASP headers essential for production
- Resource ownership validation required

### Performance

- Redis caching with fallback = best practice
- N+1 queries fix most API performance issues
- Composite indexes > single field indexes
- Bundle analysis catches bloat early

### DevOps

- 7-phase CI/CD catches issues early
- Parallel phases faster than sequential
- Security scanning non-negotiable
- Health checks critical for uptime
