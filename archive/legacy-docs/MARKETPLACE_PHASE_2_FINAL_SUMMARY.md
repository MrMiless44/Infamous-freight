## � Pricing Algorithm

**File**: `apps/api/src/lib/pricing.js`

### Formula

```
Price = (Base + Distance + Weight + Volume) × (1 - PlanDiscount)
Minimum = Base Rate
```

### Base Rates by Vehicle

| Vehicle        | Base |
| -------------- | ---- |
| CAR            | $8   |
| SUV            | $12  |
| VAN            | $18  |
| BOX_TRUCK      | $45  |
| STRAIGHT_TRUCK | $70  |
| SEMI           | $120 |

### Fees

- **Distance**: $1.50/mile
- **Weight**: $0.01/lb over 200 lbs
- **Volume**: $0.10/cu ft over 50 cu ft
- **Plan Discount**: STARTER -10%, PRO -15%, ENTERPRISE -20%

### Example

BOX_TRUCK, 20 mi, 500 lbs, 100 cu ft, PRO shipper:

```
Base: $45
Distance: 20 × $1.50 = $30
Weight: (500-200) × $0.01 = $3
Volume: (100-50) × $0.10 = $5
Subtotal: $83
Discount (15%): -$12.45
Final: $70.55 ✓
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### POST /api/marketplace/jobs

Creates job in REQUIRES_PAYMENT status.

**Request**:

```json
{
  "shipperId": "user-123",
  "pickupAddress": "123 Main St, NYC",
  "pickupLat": 40.7128,
  "pickupLng": -74.006,
  "dropoffAddress": "456 Park Ave, NYC",
  "dropoffLat": 40.758,
  "dropoffLng": -73.9855,
  "requiredVehicle": "BOX_TRUCK",
  "weightLbs": 500,
  "volumeCuFt": 100,
  "estimatedMiles": 20,
  "estimatedMinutes": 45
}
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "job": {
    "id": "job-abc",
    "status": "REQUIRES_PAYMENT",
    "priceUsd": "70.55",
    "payment": {
      "id": "payment-xyz",
      "status": "INITIATED",
      "amountUsd": "70.55"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### POST /api/marketplace/jobs/:jobId/checkout

Creates Stripe Checkout Session.

**Headers**:

```
Authorization: Bearer $JWT
Idempotency-Key: unique-request-id (optional)
```

**Response**:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "checkoutUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/pay/cs_test_...",
  "sessionId": "cs_test_..."
}
```

**Flow**:

1. GET checkoutUrl
2. Redirect to checkout (user enters card)
3. Success → redirect to `PUBLIC_APP_URL/payment/success?jobId=...`
4. Stripe webhook fires → Payment SUCCEEDED → Job OPEN
5. Driver can now see & accept job

---

## 🔐 Webhook Handler

**File**: `apps/api/src/marketplace/webhooks.js`  
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`

### Events Handled

| Event                        | Action                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `checkout.session.completed` | Payment SUCCEEDED → Job OPEN |
| `customer.subscription.*`    | Update plan tier/status      |
| `invoice.payment_*`          | Update subscription status   |

### Idempotency Protection

```javascript
if (processedEvents.has(event.id)) {
  return { received: true, duplicate: true };
}
processedEvents.add(event.id);
```

- No duplicate job opens
- No double charges
- Safe webhook replay

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Export Stripe test keys
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."

# 2. Start API
cd apps/api && pnpm dev
```

### Test Job Creation

```bash
JOB=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/marketplace/jobs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "shipperId": "user-123",
    "pickupAddress": "123 Main St",
    "pickupLat": 40.7,
    "pickupLng": -74.0,
    "dropoffAddress": "456 Park Ave",
    "dropoffLat": 40.75,
    "dropoffLng": -73.9,
    "requiredVehicle": "BOX_TRUCK",
    "weightLbs": 500,
    "volumeCuFt": 100,
    "estimatedMiles": 20,
    "estimatedMinutes": 45
  }')

echo $JOB | jq '.job.status'  # Should be REQUIRES_PAYMENT
JOB_ID=$(echo $JOB | jq -r '.job.id')
```

### Test Checkout

```bash
CHECKOUT=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/marketplace/jobs/$JOB_ID/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -d '{}')

echo $CHECKOUT | jq '.checkoutUrl'
# Copy URL and open in browser
# Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
# Expiry: 12/25, CVC: 123
```

### Verify Webhook

```bash
# After payment succeeds, check job status
curl http://localhost:4000/api/marketplace/jobs/$JOB_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" | jq '.job.status'
# Should be OPEN (payment succeeded via webhook)
```

## 🔐 Security Layers

| Layer                      | Mechanism             | Impact                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Signature Verification** | STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET | Prevent forged webhooks      |
| **Idempotency Keys**       | Passed to Stripe API  | No duplicate checkouts       |
| **Event Deduplication**    | processedEvents Set   | No duplicate job opens       |
| **Database Transactions**  | prisma.$transaction   | Atomic payment + job updates |
| **State Validation**       | validateTransition()  | No invalid status chains     |
| **JWT Authentication**     | Bearer token required | Unauthorized access blocked  |

---

## 📊 Data Flows

### Happy Path (Payment Success)

```
1. Shipper creates job → REQUIRES_PAYMENT
2. Shipper opens checkout URL
3. User completes payment on Stripe
4. Stripe sends webhook: checkout.session.completed
5. API marks payment SUCCEEDED
6. API opens job (OPEN)
7. Driver sees job → accepts
8. Driver picks up & delivers
```

### Failure Cases

**User closes Stripe Checkout**: Job stays REQUIRES_PAYMENT, driver can't see it

**Payment fails**: Job stays REQUIRES_PAYMENT, shipper can retry

**Webhook fails**: Automatic retry 3×, user can manually check payment status

**Duplicate webhook**: Ignored via deduplication cache, job unchanged

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Copy `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Copy `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from Webhook Endpoint settings
- [ ] Set `PUBLIC_APP_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Set `PUBLIC_API_URL` to API domain
- [ ] Run `pnpm prisma migrate deploy`
- [ ] Restart API: `docker restart api` or `pm2 restart api`
- [ ] Test checkout with Stripe test card
- [ ] Monitor webhook logs: `tail -f api.log | grep webhook`

---

## 🔜 Phase 3+ Roadmap

- **Refunds**: Shipper can refund before pickup
- **Driver Payouts**: Automated transfers via Stripe Connect
- **Subscriptions**: Monthly premium plans
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Surge pricing by demand/supply
- **Invoices**: Email receipts after payment
- **Multi-Currency**: International payments
