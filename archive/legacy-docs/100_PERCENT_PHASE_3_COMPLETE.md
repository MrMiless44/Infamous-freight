## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture

- **Monorepo:** Shared code and types via `@infamous-freight/shared`
- **ORM:** Prisma for type-safe database access
- **Authentication:** JWT with scopes for fine-grained control
- **Caching:** Redis for high-performance access
- **Real-time:** Socket.io for WebSocket support
- **Monitoring:** Datadog + Sentry for production visibility

### Patterns

- **State Machine:** For job status transitions (prevents invalid states)
- **Circuit Breaker:** For external API resilience (Stripe)
- **Event Sourcing:** Webhook events stored for replay
- **Cache-Aside:** Strategic caching of frequently accessed data
- **Exponential Backoff:** For webhook retries

### Technology Choices

- **Node.js + Express:** Fast, proven, large ecosystem
- **PostgreSQL:** Reliable, proven, great for ACID transactions
- **Redis:** Sub-millisecond performance, great for cache/dedup
- **Stripe:** Industry-standard payment processing
- **Twilio:** SMS notifications
- **Firebase:** Push notifications
- **Socket.io:** WebSocket abstraction
- **Winston:** Structured logging
