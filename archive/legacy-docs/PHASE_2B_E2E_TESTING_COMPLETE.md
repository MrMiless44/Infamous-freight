## What Was Built

### 1. Custom Test Framework (`/e2e/test-runner.js`)

- **180+ lines** of pure Node.js testing framework
- **No external dependencies** (no Playwright/Jest needed)
- **Features:**
  - Async/await test execution
  - HTTP request helper with auth
  - Assertion library (expect API)
  - Colored console output
  - Pass/fail counting
  - Coverage calculation
  - Stack traces on failure

### 2. Comprehensive Test Suite (`/e2e/tests/api.test.js`)

- **18 E2E tests** covering all API endpoints
- **Test categories:**
  - Authentication & security
  - CRUD operations
  - Pagination & filtering
  - Sorting & search
  - Error handling
  - HTTP headers
  - Rate limiting
- **290+ lines** of test code

## Bugs Fixed During Testing

### Bug #1: Double Header Send ✅

**Issue:** Server crashed with "Cannot write headers after they are sent to the
client" **Root Cause:** Authentication middleware sent response but didn't
return early **Fix:** Updated production-server.js line 145-151 to properly
return after auth failure **Impact:** Eliminated server crashes on auth failures

### Bug #2: DELETE 500 Instead of 404 ✅

**Issue:** DELETE /api/shipments/99999 returned 500 instead of 404 **Root
Cause:** database.js `deleteShipment()` threw error instead of returning null
**Fix:** Changed database.js line 229 to return null for not found **Impact:**
Proper HTTP status codes for DELETE operations

## Test Framework Features

### Assertion API

```javascript
expect(value).toBe(expected); // Strict equality
expect(value).toEqual(expected); // Deep equality (JSON)
expect(value).toContain(substring); // String/array contains
expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(n); // Numeric comparison
expect(value).toBeTruthy(); // Truthy check
expect(value).toBeFalsy(); // Falsy check
expect(value).toHaveProperty("key"); // Object property check
```

### HTTP Helper

```javascript
await runner.request("GET", "/api/shipments");
await runner.request("POST", "/api/shipments", { data });
await runner.request("PUT", "/api/shipments/1", { updates });
await runner.request("DELETE", "/api/shipments/1");
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Start API server
node apps/api/production-server.js &

# Run E2E tests
node e2e/tests/api.test.js

# Expected output:
# 🧪 Running 18 tests...
# ✓ ... (18 passing tests)
# Test Results:
#   Passed: 18
#   Failed: 0
#   Total: 18
#   Coverage: 100%
```

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Endpoints Tested

- ✅ GET /api/health (health check)
- ✅ GET /api/shipments (list with filters)
- ✅ GET /api/shipments/:id (single shipment)
- ✅ POST /api/shipments (create)
- ✅ PUT /api/shipments/:id (update)
- ✅ DELETE /api/shipments/:id (delete)

### Features Tested

- ✅ JWT Authentication (required on all endpoints)
- ✅ Pagination (page, limit parameters)
- ✅ Filtering (by status)
- ✅ Search (by origin/destination)
- ✅ Sorting (by field, asc/desc)
- ✅ Error handling (404, 401, 400)
- ✅ CORS headers
- ✅ Security headers
- ✅ Rate limiting (basic)

### Edge Cases Tested

- ✅ Missing authentication token
- ✅ Invalid authentication token
- ✅ Non-existent resource (404)
- ✅ Invalid data (400/422)
- ✅ Multiple concurrent requests
- ✅ Empty result sets

## Performance Metrics

| Metric               | Value                   |

## CI/CD Integration

To add to GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Start API
        run: node apps/api/production-server.js &
      - name: Wait for API

        run: node e2e/tests/api.test.js
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:

1. **Performance tests** - Response time assertions
2. **Stress tests** - Concurrent requests
3. **Data validation** - Schema validation
4. **Authentication flows** - Login/logout tests
5. **Negative tests** - SQL injection, XSS
6. **Integration tests** - Multiple endpoint flows
7. **Snapshot testing** - Response structure validation
8. **Test coverage reports** - HTML/JSON output

## Comparison to Playwright

**Custom Framework vs. Playwright:**

| Feature         | Custom             | Playwright              |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Installation    | None needed        | npm install             |
| Dependencies    | 0                  | ~50 packages            |
| Size            | 470 lines          | ~100MB                  |
| Speed           | Fast (native Node) | Slower (browser)        |
| HTTP testing    | ✅ Built-in        | ⚠️ Via page.goto        |
| API testing     | ✅ Perfect         | ⚠️ Requires workarounds |
| Browser testing | ❌ Not supported   | ✅ Full support         |
| Setup time      | 0 minutes          | 5-10 minutes            |

**Conclusion:** Custom framework is perfect for API testing without browser UI
needs.
