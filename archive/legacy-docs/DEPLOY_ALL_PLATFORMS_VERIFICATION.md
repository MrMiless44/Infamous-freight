# 3. ✅ Pushes to GitHub (triggers GitHub Pages + Actions)
# 4. ✅ Displays all one-click deployment links
# 5. ✅ Shows deployment summary
```

### Manual Deployment (CLI)

**Vercel**:

```bash
pnpm add -g vercel@latest
vercel --prod
```

**Netlify**:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login

## 📊 TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY

After deploying to all platforms, incoming traffic should be routed for optimal
performance:

### Option 1: CloudFlare as Primary CDN (Recommended)

- Primary: Cloudflare (310+ cities, 120+ countries)
- Fallback: Vercel (70+ locations)
- Backup: Netlify (6 zones)
- Emergency: GitHub Pages (global)

### Option 2: Load Balancing

- Use DNS provider (Route 53, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Distribute traffic across all 5 platforms
- Health checks for automatic failover

### Option 3: Geographic Routing

- North America → Vercel (closest)
- Europe → Cloudflare (comprehensive coverage)
- Asia → Render (optimal regions)
- Australia → Netlify (good coverage)
- Fallback → GitHub Pages (always available)
