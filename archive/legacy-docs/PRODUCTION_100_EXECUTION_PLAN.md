## 🚀 Phase 1: Load Testing (Day 1)

### Step 1.1: Run Baseline Load Test

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start services (if not running)
cd /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Terminal 2: Wait for services to be ready (30-60 seconds)
sleep 30

# Verify API is healthy
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health

# Generate test JWT token (or use existing)
JWT_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/test-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"admin"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Run load test
bash scripts/load-test.sh \
  --url http://localhost:3001 \
  --concurrent 50 \
  --requests 1000 \
  --token "$JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Request success rate > 99%
- ✅ P95 response time < 500ms
- ✅ P99 response time < 2s
- ✅ Error rate < 1%

### Step 1.2: Run Stress Test (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# Push system to limits with higher concurrency
bash scripts/load-test.sh \
  --url http://localhost:3001 \
  --concurrent 500 \
  --requests 10000 \
  --token "$JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ System remains stable
- ✅ No cascading failures
- ✅ Cache hit rate > 80%
- ✅ Database connection pool adequate

### Step 1.3: Document Results

Create `LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md`:

```markdown
# Load Test Results - January 16, 2026

## Baseline Test (50 concurrent, 1000 total requests)

- Success Rate: \_\_\_%
- P50 Latency: \_\_ms
- P95 Latency: \_\_ms
- P99 Latency: \_\_ms
- Throughput: \_\_ req/sec

## Stress Test (500 concurrent, 10000 total requests)

- Success Rate: \_\_\_%
- Peak Memory: \_\_MB
- Cache Hit Rate: \_\_\_%
- Errors: \_\_\_

## Approved By: ****\_**** Date: ****\_****
```

---

## 🔐 Phase 2: SSL Certificate Setup (Day 1)

### Step 2.1: Generate/Obtain Certificates

**Option A: Self-Signed (Development/Staging)**

```bash
mkdir -p nginx/ssl

# Generate 365-day self-signed cert
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key \
  -out nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Infamous Freight/CN=infamous-freight.example.com"

chmod 600 nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key
```

**Option B: Let's Encrypt (Production)**

```bash
# Use certbot for automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -v /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises/nginx/ssl:/etc/letsencrypt \
  certbot/certbot certonly --standalone \
  -d infamous-freight.example.com \
  -d www.infamous-freight.example.com \
  --email admin@infamous-freight.example.com \
  --agree-tos
```

### Step 2.2: Verify Certificates

```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt -text -noout | grep -A 2 "Validity"

# Verify key matches certificate
openssl x509 -in nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt -noout -modulus | md5sum
openssl rsa -in nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key -noout -modulus | md5sum
# Both MD5 hashes should match
```

### Step 2.3: Update Nginx Configuration

Verify `nginx/nginx.conf` contains:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name infamous-freight.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key;

    # Security headers
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
}
```
