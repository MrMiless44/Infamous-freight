## Pre-Deployment Validation

Before starting deployment, validate everything is ready:

```bash
# From repository root
bash validate-deployment.sh
```

This checks:

- ✅ Repository structure (Dockerfile.api, fly.toml, etc.)
- ✅ Required CLI tools (git, curl, flyctl)
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ Git status
- ✅ API configuration

If all checks pass ✅, you're ready to deploy.

---

## Complete Automated Deployment (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to deploy everything 100% automatically:

```bash
# Run the complete automated deployment
bash deploy-complete-100.sh
```

This single script handles all 5 steps:

1. **Authenticate** with Fly.io (opens browser)
2. **Deploy** API to Fly.io (5 min)
3. **Configure** all secrets (3 min)
4. **Migrate** database (2 min)
5. **Test** payment flow (1 min)

The script will:

- ✅ Install Fly CLI if needed
- ✅ Authenticate with your Fly.io account
- ✅ Build and deploy Docker image
- ✅ Prompt for API keys securely
- ✅ Configure environment secrets
- ✅ Run database migrations
- ✅ Verify everything works
- ✅ Provide next steps

**Total time: ~15 minutes**

---

## Manual Step-by-Step

If you prefer manual control or need to troubleshoot:

### Step 1: Authenticate with Fly.io

```bash
# Login to your Fly.io account
flyctl auth login

# Verify authentication
flyctl auth whoami
```

### Step 2: Deploy API to Fly.io

```bash
# Navigate to repo root
cd /workspaces/Infamous-freight-enterprises

# Deploy with canary strategy (rolling updates, safe)
flyctl deploy --remote-only --strategy=canary

# Or deploy with standard strategy (faster)
flyctl deploy --remote-only

# Check deployment status
flyctl status

# View logs
flyctl logs --recent
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Secrets

Get your API keys first:

- **Stripe Secret Key**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys (sk*live*...)
- **Stripe Publishable Key**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys (pk*live*...)
- **Stripe Webhook Secret**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks (whsec\_...)
- **PayPal Client ID**: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/
- **PayPal Client Secret**: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/
- **Database URL**: postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db

```bash
# Set all secrets at once
flyctl secrets set \
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_YOUR_KEY" \
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_YOUR_SECRET" \
  PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_ID" \
  PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET" \
  JWT_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." \
  NODE_ENV="production"

# Verify secrets are set
flyctl secrets list
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

```bash
# SSH into Fly.io machine and run migrations
flyctl ssh console -C "cd /app/api && pnpm prisma migrate deploy && pnpm prisma generate"

# Or with full console access
flyctl ssh console

# Then inside console:
# cd /app/api
# pnpm prisma migrate deploy
# pnpm prisma generate
# exit
```

### Step 5: Register Webhooks

#### Stripe Webhook

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Endpoint URL:
   `https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/api/billing/webhook`
4. Subscribe to events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Copy "Signing secret" and use as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

#### PayPal Webhook

1. Go to: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/
2. Navigate to: Notifications > Webhooks
3. Create webhook with URL:
   `https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/api/billing/paypal-webhook`
4. Subscribe to events:
   - `PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED`
   - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED`
   - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.UPDATED`
   - `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`

### Step 6: Test Payment Flow

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/health

# Should respond: "ok"

# Check Fly.io status
flyctl status

# Should show all machines "Passed" for health checks
```

Then test from web app:

1. Visit: https://infamous-freight-enterprises-git-\*.vercel.app
2. Click "Subscribe" or "Upgrade"
3. Select subscription tier
4. Enter test card: **4242 4242 4242 4242**
5. Expiry: **12/34**
6. CVC: **123**
7. Click "Pay"
8. Verify payment succeeds

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `flyctl: command not found`

**Solution:**

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"
flyctl --version
```

### Issue: Authentication fails

**Solution:**

```bash
# Clear old auth
flyctl auth logout

# Login fresh
flyctl auth login
```

### Issue: Deployment fails

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check logs
flyctl logs --recent

# Verify Dockerfile.api exists
ls -la Dockerfile.api

# Rebuild from scratch
flyctl apps destroy infamous-freight-enterprises  # WARNING: destructive
flyctl deploy --remote-only
```

### Issue: Health checks failing

**Solution:**

```bash
# SSH into machine
flyctl ssh console

# Check API is running
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Check logs
tail -f /app/logs/*

# Exit console
exit
```

### Issue: Database connection error

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
flyctl secrets list

# Check database is accessible
flyctl ssh console -C "psql $DATABASE_URL -c 'SELECT 1'"

# Re-set DATABASE_URL if needed
flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
```

### Issue: Webhooks not triggering

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify webhook URLs in Stripe/PayPal
# Webhook URL: https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/api/billing/webhook

# Check signing secrets match
flyctl secrets list | grep WEBHOOK

# Watch logs for webhook calls
flyctl logs --follow | grep webhook

# Test webhook from Stripe dashboard (Webhooks > Send test event)
```

### Issue: Payments not processing

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify Stripe keys are test or production (not mixed)
flyctl secrets list | grep STRIPE

# Check API logs
flyctl logs --recent | grep -i stripe

# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/api/billing/payment-intent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 99, "currency": "USD"}'
```

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify everything works:

### 1. API Health

```bash
# Health check
curl https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/health
# Expected: "ok"

# Full status
flyctl status
# Expected: All machines "Passed"
```

### 2. API Documentation

Visit: https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/api/docs

Should show Swagger UI with all endpoints.

### 3. Billing Endpoints

```bash
# Test revenue endpoint (requires auth)
curl "https://infamous-freight-enterprises.fly.dev/api/billing/revenue?period=month" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Expected: JSON with revenue data
```

### 4. Database

```bash
# SSH and verify database
flyctl ssh console -C "psql $DATABASE_URL -c 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments;'"

# Should return: (count) 0 or more
```

### 5. Monitoring

```bash
# View real-time metrics
flyctl monitor

# View logs
flyctl logs --recent

# Watch logs live
flyctl logs --follow
```
