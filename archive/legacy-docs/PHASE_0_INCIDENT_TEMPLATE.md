## 2. DETECTION & INITIAL RESPONSE

**How Was This Detected?**

- [ ] Automated alert (PagerDuty)
- [ ] Customer report
- [ ] Team member notice
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Other: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

**Alert Details:**

```
[Paste alert message, error code, stack trace if available]
```

**Detected At:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC  
**Reported By:** [Name]  
**Acknowledged By:** [Name] at HH:MM:SS

---

## 3. INCIDENT TIMELINE

**Use This Format:**

```
HH:MM - [Who] - [What happened]
```

**Example:**

```
14:15 - ServiceAlert - High error rate detected (>5%)
14:16 - John (On-Call) - Page received, acknowledged
14:18 - John - Checked Sentry, identified slow database queries
14:22 - John - Restarted API instances to clear connections
14:25 - John - Error rate dropped to <0.5%, system recovering
14:30 - John - All metrics normal, incident resolved
```

**Actual Timeline:**

```
[Start Time] - [Who] - [What]
[Time] - [Who] - [What]
[Time] - [Who] - [What]
[Resolved Time] - [Who] - [What / All Clear]
```

---

## 4. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What Broke? (Simple Description)

```
[Plain English description of what stopped working]
Example: "Customers couldn't place shipments for 8 minutes"
```

### Why Did It Break? (Root Cause)

```
[Technical explanation of WHY it happened]
Example: "A slow database query (SELECT * FROM shipments cartesian join drivers)
exhausted the connection pool, causing new connections to timeout"
```

### When Did It Start? (Exact Timestamp)

- **Actual Start:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
- **Detection Delay:** [X minutes from start to alert]
- **Root Cause Identified:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC (after [X minutes])

### Contributing Factors

- [ ] Deployment/code change
- [ ] Infrastructure/capacity issue
- [ ] External dependency (external API down)
- [ ] Configuration issue
- [ ] Monitoring gap (should have alerted sooner)
- [ ] Other: \***\*\_\_\_\*\***

**Details:**

```
[Explain the contributing factors. Example:
- Deployment at 14:10 UTC added new feature
- New feature runs expensive database query on every request
- This query lacks an index, causing full table scan
- At peak traffic (200 req/sec), this exhausted 50-connection pool]
```

---

## 5. RESOLUTION

### What Was Done to Fix It? (Immediate Mitigation)

**Step 1: [First action taken]**

```
[What / When / Why / Result]
Example: Restarted API instances at 14:22 UTC
Why: Forces database connection pool to reset
Result: Connections dropped from 50/50 to 5/50, error rate dropped
```

**Step 2: [Second action taken]**

```
[What / When / Why / Result]
```

**Step 3: [Third action taken (if applicable)]**

```
[What / When / Why / Result]
```

### Verification (How We Confirmed Fix Worked)

- [ ] Error rate back to normal (<0.5%)
- [ ] Response latency normal (<500ms P95)
- [ ] Sentry showing no new errors
- [ ] Customer reports confirming system working
- [ ] Database load normal
- [ ] Cache hit rate normal
- [ ] All health checks passing

**Verification Time:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC

## 6. PERMANENT FIX (Follow-Up Work)

**Is a permanent fix needed?**

- [ ] No (was transient issue, unlikely to recur)
- [ ] Yes - Code change needed
- [ ] Yes - Infrastructure change needed
- [ ] Yes - Monitoring/alerting improvement needed

### If Yes - What's the fix?

**Fix 1: [Add database index]**

- Type: [ ] Code [ ] Infrastructure [ ] Monitoring [ ] Documentation
- Priority: [ ] Critical (fix today) [ ] High (fix this week) [ ] Medium (fix
  this month)
- Effort: [ ] 30 min [ ] 1-2 hours [ ] Half day [ ] Full day [ ] Multi-day
- Owner: [Name]
- Ticket: [GitHub issue #]
- Expected Outcome: Prevent [specific issue] from recurring

**Fix 2: [Add monitoring alert]**

- Type: [ ] Code [ ] Infrastructure [ ] Monitoring [ ] Documentation
- Priority: [ ] Critical [ ] High [ ] Medium
- Effort: [ ] 30 min [ ] 1-2 hours
- Owner: [Name]
- Ticket: [GitHub issue #]
- Expected Outcome: Catch this issue 5 minutes sooner next time
