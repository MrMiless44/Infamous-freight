## 🚀 PHASE 1: LOAD TESTING (1 Hour)

### Phase 1 Objective

Validate that the production environment can handle expected load and that all
services respond appropriately under stress.

### Phase 1 Pre-Checks

```bash
# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Expected: { "status": "ok", "database": "connected" }

# Generate test JWT token
JWT_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/test-token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"admin"}' | jq -r '.token')

echo "JWT Token Generated: $JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Phase 1 Execution

**Step 1.1: Baseline Load Test (50 concurrent users)**

```bash
# Run baseline load test
bash scripts/load-test.sh \
  --url http://localhost:3001 \
  --concurrent 50 \
  --requests 1000 \
  --token "$JWT_TOKEN" \
  --timeout 30

# Expected Output:
# Total Requests: 1000
# Successful: 990+ (>99%)
# Failed: <10
# P50 Latency: <100ms
# P95 Latency: <500ms
# P99 Latency: <2000ms
# Error Rate: <1%
```

**Step 1.2: Stress Test (500 concurrent users - OPTIONAL)**

```bash
# Run stress test to find breaking point
bash scripts/load-test.sh \
  --url http://localhost:3001 \
  --concurrent 500 \
  --requests 10000 \
  --token "$JWT_TOKEN" \
  --timeout 60

# Monitor system metrics during test
# Check memory usage: free -m
# Check CPU usage: top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)"
# Check connections: netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l
```

**Step 1.3: Cache Effectiveness Test**

```bash
# Run test with cache enabled
bash scripts/load-test.sh \
  --url http://localhost:3001 \
  --concurrent 100 \
  --requests 5000 \
  --token "$JWT_TOKEN" \
  --cache-strategy "hit-ratio" \
  --duration 300

# Expected Output:
# Cache Hit Ratio: >80%
# Cached Requests: 4000+
# Uncached Requests: <1000
```

## 🔐 PHASE 2: SSL CERTIFICATE SETUP (30 Minutes)

### Phase 2 Objective

Secure HTTPS connections and configure SSL/TLS termination at Nginx.

### Phase 2 Pre-Checks

```bash
# Verify nginx is installed
nginx -v

# Verify certificate storage directory exists
mkdir -p nginx/ssl

# Verify domain is resolvable (for production)
nslookup infamous-freight.example.com
```

### Phase 2 Execution (Choose Option A or B)

**Option A: Self-Signed Certificates (Development/Staging)**

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate valid for 365 days
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key \
  -out nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt \
  -days 365 -nodes \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Infamous Freight/CN=infamous-freight.example.com"

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key
chmod 644 nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt

echo "✅ Self-signed certificates created"
```

**Option B: Let's Encrypt Certificates (Production - RECOMMENDED)**

```bash
# Automated script approach
bash scripts/setup-ssl-certificates.sh \
  --environment production \
  --domain infamous-freight.example.com \
  --email admin@infamous-freight.example.com \
  --letsencrypt

# Expected Output:
# ✅ Domain verified: infamous-freight.example.com
# ✅ Certificate issued valid for 90 days
# ✅ Auto-renewal configured (cron job)
# ✅ Nginx configuration updated
# ✅ HTTPS enabled
```

### Phase 2 Verification

**Step 2.1: Verify Certificate Files**

```bash
# Check certificate validity
openssl x509 -in nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt -text -noout | grep -A 2 "Validity"

# Expected Output:
#             Not Before: Jan 16 00:00:00 2026 GMT
#             Not After : Jan 16 00:00:00 2027 GMT
```

**Step 2.2: Verify Certificate/Key Match**

```bash
# Extract modulus from certificate
CERT_MODULUS=$(openssl x509 -in nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt -noout -modulus | md5sum)

# Extract modulus from key
KEY_MODULUS=$(openssl rsa -in nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key -noout -modulus | md5sum)

# Compare
if [ "$CERT_MODULUS" = "$KEY_MODULUS" ]; then
  echo "✅ Certificate and key match"
else
  echo "❌ Certificate and key DO NOT match - ABORT"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Step 2.3: Test HTTPS Connection**

```bash
# Test HTTPS (ignore self-signed warnings for dev)
curl -k https://localhost:3001/api/health

# Expected: { "status": "ok", "database": "connected" }

# Check certificate in browser
curl -I https://localhost:3001/api/health | grep -i ssl
```

**Step 2.4: Verify Nginx Configuration**

```bash
# Check nginx SSL configuration
grep -A 5 "ssl_certificate" nginx/nginx.conf

# Expected:
# ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.crt;
# ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/infamous-freight.key;

# Test nginx configuration syntax
nginx -t

# Expected: nginx: configuration file test is successful
```

**Step 2.5: Verify Security Headers**

```bash
# Check for security headers
curl -I https://localhost:3001/api/health | grep -i "Strict-Transport-Security"

# Expected:
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

✅ **MUST PASS**:

- [ ] Certificate files exist and are readable
- [ ] Certificate validity: 365+ days remaining
- [ ] Certificate and key modulus match
- [ ] HTTPS connections work (curl without errors)
- [ ] Nginx responds on port 443
- [ ] Security headers present

✅ **NICE TO HAVE**:

- [ ] Certificate chain valid
- [ ] OCSP stapling configured
- [ ] Auto-renewal cron job running

### Phase 2 Failure Handling

| Issue                    | Action                                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Certificate/key mismatch | Re-generate certificates using correct command |
| Nginx config error       | Review nginx.conf syntax, check file paths     |
| Certificate expired      | Use Let's Encrypt or purchase new certificate  |
| Port 443 not accessible  | Check firewall rules, verify Nginx is running  |
