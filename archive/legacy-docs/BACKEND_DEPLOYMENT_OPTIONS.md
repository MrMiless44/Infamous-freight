   ssh user@server
   cd ~/app
   ```

3. **Create .env.production**

   cat > .env.production << 'EOF'
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/infamousfreight
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   AI_PROVIDER=synthetic
   NODE_ENV=production
   API_PORT=4000
   EOF
   ```

4. **Build and Run**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   # Verify services running:
   docker ps
   ```

5. **Check Health**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
   # Should return: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
   ```

6. **Setup Reverse Proxy (Nginx)**

   ```bash
   # Install Nginx
   sudo apt install nginx

   # Configure as reverse proxy
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
       }
   }
   ```

   ```bash
   # Restart Nginx
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

7. **Setup SSL (Certbot)**

   sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
   ```

### Pros
