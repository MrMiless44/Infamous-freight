## 🎯 Deployment Execution (4 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment (9:55 AM)

```bash
# In terminal 1:
./scripts/switch-deployment.sh status

# In terminal 2:
./scripts/healthcheck.sh --all

# In terminal 3:
docker stats --no-stream
```

### Step 2: Execute Switch (10:00 AM)

```bash
# Single command:
./scripts/switch-deployment.sh green

# Expected output:
# ✅ Successfully switched to green deployment
```

### Step 3: Verify Switch (10:01-10:05 AM)

```bash
# Verify traffic switched:
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health | jq '.uptime'

# Check dashboards:
# - Visit http://localhost:3001 (Grafana)
# - Check API Performance dashboard
# - Verify no errors shown
```

### Step 4: Monitor (10:05-10:35 AM)

```bash
# Continuous monitoring:
./scripts/healthcheck.sh --interval 30

# Keep dashboards open for 30 minutes
# Watch for any alerts or errors

# If all green for 30 min: Deployment successful!
```

---

## 🚨 If Issues Occur

### Quick Response (< 5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Check what's wrong
./scripts/healthcheck.sh --all

# 2. If green is bad, switch back to blue
./scripts/switch-deployment.sh blue

# 3. Notify team
# Slack: "Issue detected, rolled back to blue"

# 4. Investigate
# Follow INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md
```

### Detailed Investigation (5-30 minutes)

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs api-green --tail=200 | grep -i error

# Check metrics
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health/details | jq

# Query Prometheus
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=http_requests_total" | jq
```

### Escalation (If critical)

```bash
# If issue critical and unsolved in 15 minutes:

# 1. Full rollback
./scripts/switch-deployment.sh blue

# 2. Stop green deployment
docker-compose down api-green

# 3. Page senior engineer

# 4. Follow incident response procedure
# See INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAYBOOK.md
```
