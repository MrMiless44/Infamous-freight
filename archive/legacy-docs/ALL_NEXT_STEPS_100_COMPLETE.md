3. ✅ Build Duration Tracking - Historical trends and alerts
4. ✅ Build Credit Usage Monitoring - Cost estimation and optimization

### Phase 2: Advanced Optimizations (4/4 Complete)

5. ✅ ISR Implementation - 60s revalidation on pricing page
6. ✅ Edge Middleware - Geolocation headers and security
7. ✅ Preview Branch Aliases - Auto-aliasing enabled
8. ✅ Lighthouse CI Thresholds - Enhanced performance budgets (90%+ scores)

### Phase 3: Cost Optimization (4/4 Complete)

9. ✅ Bundle Size Audit Script - Automated chunk analysis
10. ✅ Advanced Code Splitting - Vendor chunk optimization
11. ✅ Dependency Review Automation - Security and bloat detection
12. ✅ Image Loading Strategy - AVIF/WebP with CDN caching
