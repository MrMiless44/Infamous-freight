      [PERFORMANCE.md](./.github/PERFORMANCE.md)
- **Potential Savings:** 3-6 minutes (25-50%)

#### 5. **Workflow Failure Runbooks** ✅

- [x] Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide in
      [WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](./.github/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)
  - Common issues and solutions
  - Post-deployment health checks
  - Error handling procedures
- [x] Enhanced error messages in workflows
- [x] Added automatic job summaries for visibility
