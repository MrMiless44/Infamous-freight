# Infamous Freight

Infamous Freight is an AI-powered freight operations platform for dispatch automation, shipment tracking, fleet coordination, and logistics intelligence.

Built as a `pnpm` monorepo, the platform includes API, web, mobile, and shared package surfaces for modern logistics operations.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight.git
cd Infamous-freight

corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate

cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev:api
```

---

## Current Status

### Implemented

- `pnpm` monorepo workspace structure
- API, web, mobile, and shared package surfaces
- Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Redis-backed platform foundations
- validation, linting, typechecking, testing, and audit workflows
- local infrastructure helpers and deployment documentation
- CI/CD, security scanning, and release governance

### In Progress

- dispatch workflow logic
- shipment lifecycle services
- AI orchestration capabilities
- mobile operations experience
- platform expansion areas under `docs/platform-expansion/`

---

## Why It Exists

Freight operations often rely on fragmented tools, manual coordination, delayed updates, and limited visibility across the shipment lifecycle.

Infamous Freight is designed to centralize those workflows into a single logistics operating system for carriers, dispatch teams, and logistics operators.

---

## Core Capabilities

- Dispatch workflow automation
- Shipment lifecycle tracking
- Fleet coordination and monitoring
- Routing and operational analytics
- Driver workflow support
- AI-assisted operational insights

Suggested additions:

- operations dashboard
- shipment workflow view
- mobile interface

## Platform Surfaces

### Infamous Freight
**Core product**

The primary logistics platform for managing freight operations across dispatch, tracking, routing, and fleet activity.

### Genesis Avatar
**AI interface layer**

A conversational interface for interacting with operational data, workflows, and logistics intelligence across platform surfaces.

### Platform Infrastructure
**Shared foundation**

Supporting infrastructure for authentication, tenant isolation, observability, orchestration, and shared domain models.

## Monorepo Structure

```text
apps/
  api/        Backend logistics engine
  web/        Operations dashboard
  mobile/     Mobile operations interface

packages/
  shared/     Shared schemas, utilities, and domain models
```

> This overview highlights the primary product surfaces. Additional internal workspaces such as `apps/ai`, `apps/worker`, and `packages/genesis` may also exist in the monorepo.

---

## Surface Responsibilities

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/api` | Platform orchestration and logistics engine |
| `apps/web` | Operations dashboard and control plane |
| `apps/mobile` | Field operations interface |
| `packages/shared` | Shared types, schemas, constants, and utilities |

---

## Repository Boundaries

To keep onboarding clear in a large repository:

- `apps/*` and `packages/*` are the primary product workspaces
- `infra/*` contains deployment and infrastructure assets
- top-level experiments or prototypes outside core workspaces should be treated as non-core unless explicitly tied to active roadmap work

When opening a PR, make it clear whether the change targets:

1. Core product workspace
2. Platform infrastructure
3. Experimental or incubating surfaces

---

## Common Commands

```bash
pnpm install          # install workspace dependencies
pnpm dev:api          # run API in dev mode
pnpm dev:web          # run web dashboard
pnpm dev:mobile       # run mobile app
pnpm build            # generate Prisma client (offline-safe) + build workspaces
pnpm lint             # lint all workspaces
pnpm typecheck        # strict TypeScript checks
pnpm test             # run workspace tests serially
pnpm health           # lint + typecheck + test
pnpm validate         # full build + typecheck + lint + test
pnpm audit            # dependency audit
pnpm audit:prod       # production dependency audit
```

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight.git
cd Infamous-freight
```

### Enable pnpm via Corepack

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate
```

### Reproducible Local Setup (NVM + pnpm)

To match CI and local automation, use the repository-configured Node version before installing dependencies:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
if [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ]; then
  . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
else
  echo "NVM is required for this setup. Install it first: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating" >&2
  exit 1
fi

nvm install 24
nvm use 24

corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate

node -v
pnpm -v
```

### Copy Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

> Runtime requirement: this repository enforces Node.js 24.x. If your local runtime does not match the pinned version, `pnpm` may fail with `ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE`.

If that happens:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate
pnpm install
```

### Initialize Database Tooling for Local Development

```bash
createdb infamous_freight
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

### Build the Workspace

```bash
pnpm build
```

---

## Development

Canonical developer workflows use `pnpm` scripts. `make` targets are convenience wrappers around the same flows.

### Recommended Daily Flow

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:api
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
```

### API

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

### Web Dashboard

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

### Mobile App

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile
```

---

## Local Infrastructure

Infamous Freight includes a local development environment with:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- API container

### Start Infrastructure

```bash
make infra-up
```

### View Logs

```bash
make infra-logs
```

### Run the Smoke Test

```bash
make smoke
```

### Stop Infrastructure

```bash
make infra-down
```

The smoke test validates the `/health` endpoint to confirm that platform services are running correctly.

---

## Validation

Before opening a pull request, run the validation suite:

```bash
pnpm run validate
```

Or step by step:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

CI enforces baseline coverage thresholds for coverage-enabled test suites.

---

## Runtime Policy

- Required runtime: Node.js 24.x
- Required package manager: `pnpm` 10.x
- Source of truth: `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, and root `package.json`

If your local environment does not match these versions, switch before running installs or checks.

---

## Makefile Commands

```bash
make install
make build
make typecheck
make lint
make test
make validate
make dev
make infra-up
make infra-down
make infra-logs
make smoke
```
