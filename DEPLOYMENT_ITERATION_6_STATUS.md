# 🚀 Iteration #6: Full Build Isolation (Recommendation #1)

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & PUSHED**  
**Commit**: b1cd44d4 + 5bb995a3 (workflow trigger)  
**Approach**: `npm --prefix apps/web run build` for complete workspace isolation  
**Workflow**: Will auto-trigger from commit 5bb995a3  

---

## What Was Changed

### Step 7 Build Command (NEW)

```bash
BUILD_TARGET=firebase NODE_ENV=production SKIP_PREBUILD=true npm --prefix apps/web run build
```

**Key Differences from Iteration #5:**
- **No `cd apps/web`** - runs from workspace root
- **Uses `--prefix apps/web`** - npm scopes all operations to apps/web directory only
- **Full isolation** - no workspace resolution, no pnpm recursion
- **Environment variables preserved** - BUILD_TARGET, NODE_ENV, SKIP_PREBUILD all passed

### Directory Path Updates

- Out directory check: `apps/web/out` (not `out`)
- Size check: `du -sh apps/web/out/` (not `du -sh out/`)

---

## Why This Should Work

### Problem Root Cause (All 5 Previous Failures)
All previous attempts failed because:
1. npm's prebuild lifecycle hook triggers automatically
2. Prebuild script runs: `pnpm -w --filter @infamous-freight/shared build`
3. The `-w` flag causes recursive workspace build
4. Recursive build includes `apps/mobile` with `expo build`
5. Expo build fails in GitHub Actions (no credentials)

### Solution: Full Isolation with `--prefix`

**`npm --prefix apps/web`** tells npm:
- ✅ Run ALL commands in `apps/web` context only
- ✅ Use `apps/web/package.json` and `apps/web/node_modules`
- ✅ No workspace resolution or linking
- ✅ No recursive builds to sibling packages (mobile, api)
- ✅ Environment variables still work normally

**Even if prebuild runs**, it will:
- Run in isolated `apps/web` context
- Not trigger workspace-level pnpm commands
- Skip expo build (not in `apps/web` dependencies)

---

## Comparison: All 6 Iterations

| # | Approach | Command | Result | Why Failed/Success |
|---|----------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Recursive pnpm | `pnpm build` | ❌ | Triggered recursive workspace build |
| 2 | npx direct | `npx next build` | ❌ | Workspace linking issue |
| 3 | Ignore scripts | `npm build --ignore-scripts` | ❌ | Flag didn't prevent prebuild |
| 4 | Direct binary | `./node_modules/.bin/next build` | ❌ | Binary path/execution issue |
| 5 | Conditional prebuild | `SKIP_PREBUILD=true npm build` | ❌ | Prebuild still triggered somehow |
| 6 | **Full isolation** | `npm --prefix apps/web build` | 🔄 **TESTING** | **Should work - no workspace access** |

## Commits Pushed

### Commit 1: b1cd44d4
```
fix: use npm --prefix for full build isolation (Recommendation #1)

- Changed Step 7 to: npm --prefix apps/web run build
- No cd command - runs in workspace root context
- Full isolation from monorepo workspace issues
- Prevents recursive pnpm workspace build
- Shared package already built in Step 6
- Updated out/ directory path check to apps/web/out/
```

### Commit 2: 5bb995a3
```
chore: trigger Firebase workflow
```
- Added `apps/web/.trigger` file to trigger workflow via path filter
- Workflow filter requires changes to `apps/web/**` to trigger

---

## Monitoring the Deployment

### Check Workflow Status

1. **GitHub Actions Page**:
   - URL: https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight/actions
   - Look for "Deploy Firebase Hosting" workflow
   - Should show commit 5bb995a3 (or b1cd44d4)
   - Status: queued → in_progress → completed

2. **Direct Workflow Link** (once created):
   - Will appear within ~30 seconds of push
   - Filter by "Deploy Firebase Hosting"
   - Check Step 7: "Build Next.js for Firebase"

3. **Expected Timeline**:
   - Setup & checkout: ~30s
   - Install dependencies: ~60s
   - Build shared package: ~20s
   - **Build Next.js (CRITICAL)**: ~90s ← **THIS IS THE TEST**
   - Deploy to Firebase: ~30s
   - **TOTAL**: ~4 minutes

### Success Indicators

✅ **Step 7 should show**:
```
Building Next.js application...

> infamous-freight-web@1.0.0 build
> next build

Prebuild skipped
✓ Creating an optimized production build
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (45 pages)
✓ Build successful
5.4M    apps/web/out/
```

❌ **If it fails, look for**:
- Expo build errors (shouldn't happen with `--prefix`)
- Missing dependencies in apps/web
- Different error than previous iterations

---

## What Happens Next

### If This Works ✅

1. **Step 7 passes** - Build completes successfully
2. **Steps 8-12 run** - Verification, Firebase CLI, deployment
3. **Website goes live** at:
   - https://infamousfreight.web.app
   - https://infamousfreight.com (if DNS configured)
4. **Victory** - Monorepo build issue finally solved! 🎉

### If This Fails ❌

**Next options**:
1. **Remove prebuild entirely** from `apps/web/package.json`
   - Shared already built in Step 6
   - Prebuild is redundant anyway
2. **Move apps/web out of monorepo** temporarily
   - Build in separate isolated workflow
   - Merge back after deployment
3. **Use Docker container** with pre-built state
   - Build shared locally
   - Deploy pre-built Next.js app only

## Technical Details

### npm --prefix Behavior

```bash
npm --prefix apps/web run build
```

**What npm does**:
1. Changes working directory to `apps/web`
2. Reads `apps/web/package.json`
3. Uses `apps/web/node_modules`
4. Runs `"build": "next build"` script
5. If prebuild exists, runs it in `apps/web` context only
6. No awareness of parent workspace or sibling packages

**Contrast with `cd apps/web && npm run build`**:
- Both start in `apps/web` directory
- But `cd` version maintains workspace awareness
- `--prefix` version isolates completely

### Environment Variable Passing

```bash
BUILD_TARGET=firebase NODE_ENV=production SKIP_PREBUILD=true npm --prefix apps/web run build
```

All three variables are available to:
- The build script itself
- Any lifecycle hooks (prebuild, postbuild)
- The Next.js build process
- Child processes spawned during build

---

## Lessons Learned

### What We Know Now

1. **npm lifecycle hooks are sticky**
   - Can't easily disable with flags
   - `--ignore-scripts` doesn't affect lifecycle hooks
   - Conditional logic is better than trying to bypass

2. **Monorepo builds are complex**
   - Workspace linking creates hidden dependencies
   - pnpm `-w` flag causes recursive builds
   - Isolation is safer than clever scripting

3. **Environment differences matter**
   - Local build success doesn't guarantee CI success
   - GitHub Actions has different node/npm/pnpm setup
   - Test in CI environment when possible

4. **Full isolation wins**
   - `--prefix` is cleaner than `cd` + workspace context
   - Removes all workspace awareness
   - Prevents cascading build failures

### Debugging Approach

1. ✅ Identified root cause (recursive workspace build)
2. ✅ Tried 5 different mitigation strategies
3. ✅ Tested each locally (when possible)
4. ✅ Analyzed GitHub Actions logs for each failure
5. ✅ Escalated to full isolation approach
6. ✅ Documented learnings for future reference

## Files Modified

### .github/workflows/deploy-firebase-hosting.yml

**Step 7 - Before:**
```yaml
- name: Build Next.js for Firebase
  run: |
    echo "Building Next.js application..."
    cd apps/web
    BUILD_TARGET=firebase NODE_ENV=production SKIP_PREBUILD=true npm run build
    if [ ! -d "out" ]; then
      echo "ERROR: out directory not created!"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "✓ Build successful"
    du -sh out/
```

**Step 7 - After:**
```yaml
- name: Build Next.js for Firebase
  run: |
    echo "Building Next.js application..."
    BUILD_TARGET=firebase NODE_ENV=production SKIP_PREBUILD=true npm --prefix apps/web run build
    if [ ! -d "apps/web/out" ]; then
      echo "ERROR: out directory not created!"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "✓ Build successful"
    du -sh apps/web/out/
```

**Key change**: `npm --prefix apps/web run build` instead of `cd apps/web && npm run build`
