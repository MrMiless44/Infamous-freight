# Disaster Recovery Plan

**Status**: ✅ PLAN DOCUMENTED  
**Date**: February 19, 2026  
**Purpose**: Recover business operations after major disaster

---

## 1. Business Continuity Targets

### Recovery Objectives

| Metric | Target | Critical |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective) | 4 hours | When service must be restored |
| **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective) | 15 minutes | Maximum data loss acceptable |
| **MTBF** (Mean Time Between Failures) | > 1000 hours | Frequency of outages |
| **MTTR** (Mean Time To Repair) | < 1 hour | Speed of recovery |

### Budget Impact

- Each hour of downtime: ~$50,000 lost
- Each GB of data loss: Legal liability
- Reputation damage: Unquantifiable

---

## 2. Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario A: Complete Data Center Failure

**Likelihood**: Very Low (< 1%)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - All services offline

**Recovery Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Activate in alternate region (< 1 hour)
#    Fly.io provides multi-region capability
#    - Primary: us-east-1 (Virginia)
#    - Failover: eu-west-1 (Ireland)

# 2. Restore database from backup
fly postgres restore-backup \
  --backup-id <latest_backup_id>

# 3. Repoint DNS to alternate region
# Cloudflare: Instant failover
# TTL: 60 seconds

# 4. Verify application
curl https://infamous-freight-api.fly.dev/api/health

# 5. Notify stakeholders
# Slack, Email, Status page
```

**Recovery Time**: ~45 minutes  
**Data Loss**: 0-15 minutes

### Scenario B: Database Corruption

**Likelihood**: Low (< 5%)  
**Impact**: HIGH - Cannot process requests

**Recovery Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Take system offline (prevent further corruption)
fly apps halt infamous-freight-api

# 2. Restore from backup
pg_restore --clean \
  --file=/tmp/latest_backup.dump \
  --dbname=postgresql://...

# 3. Restore database integrity
psql -c "REINDEX DATABASE db_name;"

# 4. Bring system back online
fly apps restart infamous-freight-api

# 5. Monitor for issues
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

**Recovery Time**: ~30 minutes  
**Data Loss**: 0-15 minutes

### Scenario C: Security Breach

**Likelihood**: Low (< 3%)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Customer data compromised

**Recovery Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Isolate compromised systems
fly apps halt infamous-freight-api

# 2. Preserve evidence
# Export logs
# Backup database
# Screenshots of anomalies

# 3. Rotate all credentials
# SSH keys
# API keys
# Database passwords
# JWT secrets

# 4. Patch vulnerability
# Code fix + deploy

# 5. Bring systems back online
fly apps restart infamous-freight-api

# 6. Monitor for recurrence
# Enhanced logging
# Alerts for similar patterns
```

**Recovery Time**: 2-8 hours  
**Data Loss**: Variable (depending on breach)

### Scenario D: Code Repository Corrupted

**Likelihood**: Very Low (< 1%)  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Cannot deploy changes

**Recovery Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Clone from GitHub backup
git clone https://github.com/MrMiless44/Infamous-freight.git

# 2. Verify integrity
git fsck --full

# 3. Check all branches exist
git branch -a

# 4. Verify all commits reachable
git log --all --oneline | wc -l

# 5. Resume operations
```

**Recovery Time**: < 5 minutes  
**Data Loss**: 0 (Git distributed)

### Scenario E: DNS Hijacking

**Likelihood**: Very Low (< 1%)  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Users cannot access service

**Recovery Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Verify DNS is compromised
nslookup infamous-freight.com
# Check if IP is correct

# 2. Change DNS provider immediately
# Cloudflare: Update nameservers
# GoDaddy: If registrar is compromised, use alternate

# 3. Update registrar nameservers
# 72-hour delay possible

# 4. Temporary workaround
# Hosts file: 1.2.3.4 infamous-freight.com
# Or use IP directly in clients

# 5. Notify users of issue
```

**Recovery Time**: 5 minutes (hosts) to 72 hours (DNS)  
**Data Loss**: 0

- [ ] Create war room (Slack channel)
- [ ] Notify leadership
- [ ] Preserve evidence
- [ ] Assess scope & severity

### SHORT-TERM (5-60 minutes)

- [ ] Activate backup systems
- [ ] Restore critical systems
- [ ] Verify application functionality
- [ ] Publish status update
- [ ] Monitor for recurrence
- [ ] Document timeline

### MID-TERM (1-4 hours)

- [ ] Restore all services

- [ ] Post status
- [ ] Begin analysis

### RESTORATION (4-24 hours)

- [ ] Complete full recovery
- [ ] Restore normal operations
- [ ] Full verification
- [ ] Close incident
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem

---

## 4. Communication Plan

### Immediate Notification (within 5 min)

**Internal**:
- Slack: #incident channel
- Email: leadership@company.com
- Page: On-call team

**External**:
- Status page: "Major Incident in Progress"
- Twitter/Social: (if public company)
- Email: Key customers

### Status Updates (every 30 min)

```
[11:00 AM] Major incident detected. Services down.
          Working on immediate recovery.
          
[11:30 AM] Root cause identified: Database failure.
          Restoring from backup. ETA: 45 min.
          
[12:00 PM] Database restoration in progress (85% complete).
          Services should be online within 30 minutes.
          
[12:30 PM] Services restored. Verification in progress.
```

## 5. Alternate Sites & Failover

### Geographic Redundancy

```
Primary:   us-east-1 (Virginia, USA)
Failover:  eu-west-1 (Ireland, EU)
Backup:    ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo, Japan) [optional]

DNS: Cloudflare (global network)
     Automatic failover capability
```

### Manual Failover Procedure

```bash
# 1. Deploy to alternate region
fly deploy -a infamous-freight-api-eu

# 2. Restore database
fly postgres restore-backup \
  -a infamous-freight-db-eu \
  --backup-id <latest>

# 3. Update DNS
# Cloudflare > DNS Records > Update A records

# 4. Verify traffic flows
curl https://infamous-freight-api.fly.dev/api/health
```

---

## 6. Data Protection Strategy

### Backup Redundancy

```
On-Disk:       Fly.io PostgreSQL backup (30 days)
              ↓
Hot Backup:    AWS S3 (encrypted, replicated)
              ↓
Cold Archive:  AWS Glacier (after 90 days)
              ↓
Offsite Copy:  Monthly on encrypted USB (vault)
```

### Encryption

```bash
# Backups encrypted in S3
aws s3 ls s3://infamous-freight-backups/ \
  --sse-c-algorithm AES256

# Verify encryption
aws s3api head-object \
  --bucket infamous-freight-backups \
  --key db_backup.dump \
  --sse-c-algorithm AES256 \
  | grep ServerSideEncryption
```

## 7. Testing & Drills

### Monthly Disaster Recovery Drill

**Schedule**: First Saturday of month, 10 AM  
**Duration**: 2 hours

**Conduct Full Simulation**:
```
1. Declare fictional disaster scenario
2. Execute recovery procedures
3. Measure RTO/RPO
4. Document findings
5. Review and improve procedures
6. Communicate results to team
```

### Quarterly Failover Test

**Test alternate region**:
```bash
# Deploy test app to alternate region
fly deploy -a infamous-freight-api-eu

# Verify performance acceptable
