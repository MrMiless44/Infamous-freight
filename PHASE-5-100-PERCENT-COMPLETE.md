## 🎓 Reusable Patterns & Components

### State Machine Pattern
Use this for other entities (Users, Drivers, Billing):
```javascript
const validator = new StateMachine({
  initialState: 'PENDING',
  states: {
    PENDING: ['ASSIGNED', 'CANCELLED'],
    ASSIGNED: ['IN_TRANSIT', 'CANCELLED'],
    IN_TRANSIT: ['DELIVERED'],
    DELIVERED: [],
    CANCELLED: []
  }
});
```

### Eager Loading Factory
Apply to all list endpoints:
```javascript
const queryOptimizer = queryOptimizer.buildEagerLoad('shipment')
  .include('driver', 'customer', 'route')
  .optimize();
```

### Error Boundary Component
Wrap major UI sections:
```typescript
<ErrorBoundary fallback=<ErrorFallback>>
  <ComplexDashboard />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### Request Logger Service
Extend across all services:
```javascript
const context = requestLogger.captureContext(req);
requestLogger.logRequestStart(context);
const result = await service.operation();
requestLogger.logRequestComplete(context, result);
```

### Type Safety Utilities
Use for form validation/API responses:
```typescript
const isPerson = isAuthenticated(user);
const status = parseShipmentStatus(data.status);
const email = safeGet(user, 'contact.email');
```
