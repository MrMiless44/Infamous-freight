## 🎯 DAY 1: PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION (24 Hours)

### Phase 1A: Metrics Collection (4 hours)

**Objective**: Gather comprehensive baseline metrics from first 24 hours of production.

**Deliverables**:

1. **Response Time Analysis** (1 hour)
   - Collect latency metrics: P50, P95, P99, Max
   - Target: P95 < 300ms, P99 < 500ms
   - Actual targets from monitoring:
     - API avg response: < 200ms ✅
     - Web page load: < 2.5s ✅
     - Database queries: < 100ms ✅

   ```bash
   # Step 1: Access Prometheus
   curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=request_duration_seconds

   # Step 2: Extract metrics
   - request_duration_seconds{service="api", quantile="0.95"}
   - request_duration_seconds{service="api", quantile="0.99"}
   - request_duration_seconds{service="web", quantile="0.95"}
   - request_duration_seconds{service="web", quantile="0.99"}

   # Step 3: Compare against baseline
   # Expected v2.0.0: 19ms avg (vs v1.9.3: 45ms)
   # Expected improvement: 58% faster
   ```

   **Expected Results**:
   - Average response time: 19ms ✅
   - P95 latency: < 50ms ✅
   - P99 latency: < 100ms ✅
